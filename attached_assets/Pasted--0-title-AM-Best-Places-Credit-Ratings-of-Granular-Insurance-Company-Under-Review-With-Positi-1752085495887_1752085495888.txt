The positive implications are owing to the current financial strength of Elevance, as well as the explicit support Granular receives as a recently acquired entity. The ratings will remain under review with positive implications while AM Best has discussions with management about the strategic and financial plans for Granular.\n\nThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.
