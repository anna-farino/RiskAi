Threat Tracker Application Process Manual
Based on the console logs and application structure, here's the step-by-step process that occurs in the Threat Tracker app:

Overview
The Threat Tracker is a third module within the application that operates similarly to News Radar but focuses specifically on threat-related articles and intelligence.

Backend Process Flow
1. Threat Data Repository
Maintains a specialized database of threat-related articles
Uses /api/threat-tracker/articles as the primary endpoint
Stores threat intelligence with searchable metadata
Operates independently from News Radar and News Capsule databases
2. API Architecture
Follows the same authentication pattern as other modules
Requires valid user session for access
Returns JSON-formatted threat article data
Supports real-time filtering and search capabilities
Data Fetching Process
3. Request Initialization
Component Load: Threat Tracker interface loads in the browser
Authentication Check: System verifies user login status
API Call Preparation: Frontend constructs request parameters
Server Communication: Authenticated request sent to threat tracker endpoint
4. Filter Parameter Processing
The system processes the same filter structure as News Radar:

Default Parameters:

Search string: "" (empty)
Keyword IDs: [] (empty array)
Parameter Flow:

Frontend builds filter object with search and keyword criteria
Parameters are logged for debugging: {"search":"","keywordIds":[]}
Request includes authentication headers
Backend processes filters against threat database
5. Response Handling
Database Query: Backend searches threat articles using provided filters
Result Processing: Articles matching criteria are collected
Response Generation: Server returns count and article data
Frontend Update: Interface displays "Received filtered articles: 0"
Filtering System Architecture
6. Search Capabilities
Text Search: Users can search through threat article content
Keyword Filtering: Threat-specific keywords for categorization
Combined Filters: Multiple criteria can be applied simultaneously
Real-time Results: Interface updates as filters change
7. Empty Result Handling
Current logs show zero results, indicating:

No articles currently match the default (empty) filter criteria
Database may be empty or filters are too restrictive
System properly handles and displays empty states
No errors in the data retrieval process
Integration Architecture
8. Multi-Module Coordination
The application runs three parallel tracking systems:

Sequential Loading:

News Tracker articles fetched first
Threat Tracker articles fetched second
Both use identical parameter structures
Independent result sets maintained
Shared Components:

Same authentication system across all modules
Consistent API design patterns
Similar filtering interface design
Common error handling approaches
9. User Workflow
Module Selection: User navigates to Threat Tracker section
Data Loading: System automatically fetches available threat articles
Filter Application: User can apply search terms and keyword filters
Result Display: Matching threats are shown in the interface
Article Review: Users can examine individual threat details
Technical Implementation
10. Database Structure
Separate threat article storage from news articles
Threat-specific metadata fields
Keyword taxonomy for threat categorization
Optimized for security intelligence queries
11. Performance Characteristics
Parallel loading with News Radar for efficiency
Client-side filtering interface for responsive user experience
Server-side query processing for accuracy
Minimal network overhead with targeted requests
12. Error Management
Graceful handling of empty result sets
Network failure recovery
Authentication timeout management
Consistent logging for debugging
Data Flow Summary
The Threat Tracker follows this complete cycle:

User accesses Threat Tracker module
System makes authenticated request to /api/threat-tracker/articles
Backend processes filter parameters against threat database
Results (currently 0 articles) are returned to frontend
Interface updates to display available threats
Users can interact with filtering controls to refine results
This specialized threat tracking system complements the broader news monitoring capabilities, providing focused intelligence on security threats while maintaining the same user experience patterns as the other application modules.
