Mimicking the file structure of frontend/src/pages/dashboard/news-radar and backend/apps/news-radar I would like to create a new app called News Capsule that will live in frontend/src/pages/dashboard/news-capsule and backend/apps/news-capsule.
Follow these instructions. Prepare a plan to implement this additional application in our project. Go step by step. Do not change anything outside of our newly created file directories for News Capsule!

Important instructions about the code
Always Use Typescript both in the frontend and backend
Always use ES Modules
Always use Drizzle to query the database. Drizzle client is in the file: backend/db/db.ts (it is exported as ‘db’)
Never create a new database
Never create a new ‘server’ folder
The schemas for the database are in the folder shared/db/schema. Consider the folder shared as being read-only: never modify it!
Don’t modify the database in any way. 
If the database has to be modified, asked the user to do it
Don’t modify the Secrets. If secrets need to be modified, ask the user to do it
Purpose:
Create a full-stack web application called News Capsule Pro for cybersecurity professionals to track, analyze, and report on IT security news. The platform centralizes article ingestion and uses OpenAI to automatically generate structured, actionable threat summaries.

Core Features
📰 Article Ingestion & AI-Powered Analysis
Users submit URLs to cybersecurity-related articles.


The application uses OpenAI to process each article and extract structured threat intelligence, formatted as:


Title: [Title of the article]


Threat Name(s): [Threat, vulnerability, exploit, or CVE(s) identified in the article]


Summary: [Up to 60 words summarizing the key threat or incident]


Impacts: [Description of the business or technical impact]


OS Connection: [Operating system(s) affected, if mentioned]


Source: [Name of the original publication]


Handles multiple submissions and queues them for background processing.


Automatically classifies and labels threat type, severity, and context.


🧠 Threat Intelligence Dashboard
Presents extracted summaries in a card-based interface.


Groups related threats (e.g., same CVE or campaign) for clarity.


Filtering options: threat type, OS, keyword, date, source.


Includes a “Clear All” button to wipe dashboard results.


📝 Report Generation
Allows users to compile selected summaries into custom reports.


Export options: PDF, DOCX, JSON, Markdown.


Users can title, annotate, and tag reports for internal use.


“Clear History” button removes all stored summaries and reports.



Technical Stack
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui


Backend: Express.js with RESTful APIs


Database: PostgreSQL


ORM: Drizzle


Language: TypeScript


AI Integration: OpenAI (required) – handles summarization, threat labeling, and extraction



UI/UX Requirements
Clean, responsive interface with a cybersecurity-themed aesthetic


Threat summaries displayed as interactive cards


Works across desktop and mobile


Includes toast notifications for process feedback


Confirmation modals for irreversible actions



Intended Outcome
News Capsule Pro empowers analysts, SOC teams, and threat researchers to quickly transform security news into digestible, structured threat intelligence. With OpenAI doing the heavy lifting, users get high-quality summaries and reporting tools to support decision-making, incident response, and executive communication.
