Mimicking the file structure of frontend/src/pages/dashboard/news-radar and backend/apps/news-radar I would like to create a new app called News Capsule that will live in frontend/src/pages/dashboard/news-capsule and backend/apps/news-capsule.
Follow these instructions. Prepare a plan to implement this additional application in our project. Go step by step. Do not change anything outside of our newly created file directories for News Capsule!

Important instructions about the code
Always Use Typescript both in the frontend and backend
Always use ES Modules
Always use Drizzle to query the database. Drizzle client is in the file: backend/db/db.ts (it is exported as ‘db’)
Never create a new database
Never create a new ‘server’ folder
The schemas for the database are in the folder shared/db/schema. Consider the folder shared as being read-only: never modify it!
Don’t modify the database in any way. 
If the database has to be modified, asked the user to do it
Don’t modify the Secrets. If secrets need to be modified, ask the user to do it

Overview
● News Capsule ingests URLs to scrape and summarize articles for an executive report. 

Features 
News Capsule has two main pages: “Capsule Research” and “Executive Reporting”.
In the Capsule Research page the following should happen:
Ingests the url of the article, the url comes from the user.
The app returns a summary of article.
The user selects the summaries that they want in the report.
Summaries remain in the daily report for compilation into the Executive Report, unless removed.
Use the table ‘capsule_articles’ in the database to store the summaries
Infer the shape of the summaries from the fields of the ‘capsule_articles’ table in the database
The user clicks Send to Executive Reporting

In the Executive Reports page the following should happen:
The articles that were selected and sent from the Capsule Research Page show here.
Each day, a NEW Executive Report will be started.
Reports should be stored in the ‘reports’ table in the database
The table ‘capsule_articles_in_reports’ is a join table joining capsule_articles and reports. A report is basically a list of capsule_articles
The Executive report is composed of selected articles that were chosen by the user.
The executive report can create different versions if necessary.
Nav bar across the top
Add to every query to the database the headers that are the output of the csrfHeaderObject function that can be imported from ‘@/utils/csrf-header’. For instance:
const response = await fetch(`${serverUrl}....`, {
          method: 'GET',
          credentials: 'include',
          headers: csfrHeaderObject()
       });
const response = await fetch(`${serverUrl}....`, {
          method: 'GET',
          credentials: 'include',
          headers: {
		[some headers],
...csfrHeaderObject(),
}
       });
